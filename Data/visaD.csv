2021-01-12,Daily Crunch: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition,"Regulatory action prompts Visa to back off a fintech acquisition, Uber and Moderna partner and Checkout.com is valued at $15 billion. This is your Daily Crunch for January 12, 2021.
The big story: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition
The deal, valued at $5.3 billion, was first announced just over a year ago. However, the Department of Justice filed suit to block the acquisition in November, arguing that it would “eliminate a nascent competitive threat.”
In today’s announcement, Visa said it could still have made things work, but the threat of “protracted and complex litigation” ultimately prompted it to call things off.
What remains to be seen, however, is whether this might cool financial giants’ interest in acquiring fintech startups and unicorns.

2020-12-03,Opposing Visa’s Plaid Acquisition Is Good Antitrust Enforcement,"The Justice Department has destroyed its credibility over the past four years by prioritizing President Trumps interests over the national interest. Antitrust enforcement is no exception. The department has pursued cases against the presidents enemies, notably investigating an agreement among four auto companies to voluntarily reduce emissions, and it has declined to pursue cases against the presidents friends, allowing T-Mobile to acquire Sprint. But in pursuing the case against Visa, the department is ending the Trump era on a relatively high note, setting an example the Biden administration ought to emulate.
Debit cards, which have soared in popularity in recent decades, allow customers to make purchases by authorizing withdrawals from their bank accounts. Visa operates a system that connects the buyers bank and the merchants bank. For this service, the merchant pays a fee to Visa and to the bank that issued the card. Other companies offer a similar service, but Visa is the dominant player. It processed about 70 percent of the online debit transactions in the United States last year, a business that produced about $2 billion in profits.
Plaid is not one of Visas competitors yet. The start-up provides the plumbing that lets apps like Venmo, a cash transfer service, or Robinhood, a stock trading platform, access users bank accounts. Visas dominance rests on its exclusive relationships with the banks that issue debit cards, but Plaid now has relationships with most of the same banks.
Last year, Visa made a small, exploratory investment in Plaid. A few months later, according to the governments complaint, one of Plaids co-founders called Visa to say that the company was for sale, and the price was about $5 billion. Why would Visa pay so much for a company with revenues of $100 million last year? According to the governments complaint, Plaid made clear that it was planning to get into Visas business. The smaller company told Visa that it was preparing to launch a new system for processing online debit payments, with fees of about 50 percent of Visas.
One Visa executive described Plaids potential as a volcano with just the tip showing above the water, according to the complaint. Visa estimated it could lose a quarter of its online debit business by 2024. The companys chief executive said buying Plaid was an insurance policy. He told investors, we must always do what it takes to protect this business.","In opposing the acquisition of a nascent rival, the Justice Department is taking an important step to protect competition."
2021-01-13,Will startup valuations change given rising antitrust concerns?,"The United States has, over the past few decades, been extremely lenient on antitrust enforcement, rarely blocking deals, even with overseas competitors. Yet, there have been inklings that things are changing. Yesterday, we learned that Visa and Plaid called off their combination after the Department of Justice sued to block it in early November. We also learned a week ago that shaving startup Billie would end its proposed acquisition by consumer product goods giant P&amp;G after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December.
Many, many, many other deals of course get through the gauntlet of regulations, but even a few smoke signals is enough to start raising concerns. That new calculus is even before we start to look at the morass of reforms being proposed around antitrust in Washington DC these days, nearly all of which on a bipartisan basis would create stricter controls for antitrust, particularly in critical technology industries and information services.
So, whats the valuation prognosis for startups these days given that one of the most important exit options available is increasingly looking fraught?","The United States has, over the past few decades, been extremely lenient on antitrust enforcement, rarely blocking deals, even with overseas competitors.

2021-01-04,The Morning After: Samsung's Galaxy S21 will be revealed on January 14th,"The new year starts in earnest today, and while there’s that whole online tech show to report on soon, Samsung has decided to bookend it with the launch of its new Galaxy phones. Yep, it’s confirmed the unveiling for Thursday, January 14th — the last day of CES. (Good thing we’ve already collated everything we’re expecting to see at the event, right here.)
It's all but certain we’ll see a new Galaxy S21 family, including a basic model, the S21 Plus and S21 Ultra, possibly alongside a new set of wireless Galaxy Buds. As Chris Velazco wrote, while a launch event this early in the year is unusual for Samsung, the company's moves later in the year may prove to be even more surprising. Some rumors suggest Samsung will push ""more accessible"" (i.e. cheaper) foldable smartphones, reducing the focus on its Galaxy Note family.

Expect a wider, more aggressive-looking EV.
Tesla’s Model S design hasn’t really changed much since 2016, but it appears poised for an (arguably overdue) update. YouTube channel TheKilowatts spotted what appears to be a Model S design refresh roaming around Palo Alto. It seems to have a wider body with a more pronounced fender and wider hips, as well as changes to the wheels, lights and rear diffuser.
It’s not certain if there are any internal changes. Tesla hopes to deliver its more powerful, longer-ranged Model S Plaid in late 2021, but this redesign might not necessarily be the new Plaid model.Continue reading.

2021-01-13,Affirm doubles after starting to trade despite strong IPO pricing,"Today shares of Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later unicorn, started trading above $90 per share, far above its $49 per-share IPO price, a figure that was already miles above the companys early expectations.
The pop comes after Affirm raised its pricing range earlier this week, to $41 to $44 per share, up from an initial range of $33 to $38 per share. To see the company double from its raised price implies strong demand for its shares, a thin float, or both.
Affirms explosive debut comes on the heels of similarly-strong results from DoorDash, C3.ai, and Airbnb. Those companies debuts were so strong that Roblox delayed its IPO, later swapping a traditional IPO for a direct listing to get around the pricing issue.
Todays IPO shows that the same dynamics that were at play in those IPOs have persisted into 2021. More public debuts are expected in Q1, including Coinbase, another well-known unicorn. Other names like Robinhood, Bumble, and others are in the wings.
Affirms first-day performance will certainly raise eyebrows from regular critics of the traditional IPO process. But the company did raise more money than it perhaps anticipated, and is having a raucous first-days trading, so its hard to fret too much for the company. If its share price is still as high in a month as it is today, perhaps it was as underpriced as some will claim.
Fintech
Affirms pricing brings a green splash to a busy week for fintech giants. Yesterday, Visas $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid failed to go through due to regulatory concerns. While the fallen deal could have a chilling effect on fintech startups, Plaid told TechCrunch that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. Plaids next step, per many in the VC and tech community, will be even bigger than its once-planned $5.3 billion dollar exit.

Imo, give a few years, they'll acquire Visa.

2021-01-12,Visa just pulled the plug on its $5.3 billion bid for Plaid following DOJ suit,"Visa and Plaid have agreed to call off their $5.3 billion deal, the companies said in a statement Tuesday.
Visa announced its plans to acquire Plaid in January 2020. But the deal faced regulatory scrutiny from the Department of Justice, which filed a suit against Visa alleging the payments giant was attempting to squash a potential competitor. 
Plaid serves as the behind-the-scenes piping between third-party apps and banks, enabling the former to access financial data on customers from the latter. 
Despite axing the deal, the card network remained firm the acquisition was on solid footing. 
""We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaid's capabilities are complementary to Visa's, not competitive,"" Al Kelly, chairman and CEO of Visa, said in a statement regarding the termination of the deal. 
Visa initially planned to defend the acquisition, calling the DOJ's case ""legally flawed."" The DOJ cited internal communications at Visa in which execs discussed Plaid's threat to Visa's $4 billion debit business. 
""We believe the combination of Visa with Plaid would have delivered significant benefits, including greater innovation for developers, financial institutions and consumers,"" Kelly said. ""However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.""

Meanwhile, Plaid, which works with fellow startups like Betterment, Coinbase, and Acorns, spoke to the significant growth it saw in 2020 as financial apps saw a large increase in popularity throughout the year.
Zach Perret, CEO and cofounder of Plaid, cited a more than 60% growth in customers in 2020, and the addition of ""hundreds"" of banks to the system in a statement.
""This past year saw an unprecedented uptick in demand for the services powered by Plaid, and our priority is to support the hundreds of millions of people who now rely on fintech,"" Perret said in the statement.
""While Plaid and Visa would have been a great combination, we have decided to instead work with Visa as an investor and partner so we can fully focus on building the infrastructure to support fintech,"" he added.

2020-12-23,Negotiations fall through on FIS and Global Payments' $70 billion merger,"Payments and banking technology firm FIS and merchant ecommerce and omnichannel solutions firm Global Payments were recently in advanced talks to merge in a $70 billion deal, though negotiations have since fallen through, per The Wall Street Journal.
A FIS-Global Payments merger would have shaken up the global payments space.
Insider Intelligence
It's unclear why deal talks were unsuccessful, but the potential FIS-Global Payments merger would've been the largest of the year, according to Dealogic, as cited by The Journal. Sources say it's unlikely that talks will rev up again anytime soon, but there's a possibility that they could be revived later on, although prospects remain uncertain.
The unsuccessful merger talks between FIS and Global Payments come amid recent wide-scale M&amp;A moves throughout the payments space.
FIS created a payments powerhouse when it bought Worldpay for $35 billion in 2019. At the time, Worldpay was the largest global merchant acquirer, focusing on payment processing technology and solutions for merchants. FIS' acquisition of Worldpay gave it access to all of Worldpay's clients—adding to FIS' 20,000 global clients—and transactional data. This has enabled the firm to significantly build out its merchant services and tools, as well as strengthen its positioning as a leader in the global payments space.
Global Payments merged with TSYS last year to ramp up payment technology solutions. The $21.5 billion deal enabled both firms to leverage each other's strengths. Global Payments provides ecommerce and omnichannel solutions for over 2.5 million businesses, including point-of-sale (POS) offerings and credit terminals. Meanwhile, TSYS provided credit card processing, issuing, and merchant acquiring services as well as other payment offerings to over 3.5 million small business locations and more than 1,300 financial institutions. Combined, both firms offer wide-ranging payment solutions to serve a large global client network.
A potential FIS-Global Payments merger would have shaken up the global payments space by consolidating a plethora of payment offerings—though the deal might've faced antitrust scrutiny. There has been ongoing M&amp;A activity in 2020 as firms look to consolidate payment solutions to keep pace with rapid industry change. Earlier this year, France-based Worldline received EU approval to move forward with its acquisition of Ingenico, helping provide a wide range of digital payment capabilities for merchants.
Meanwhile, Visa announced plans to purchase payments technology firm Plaid to expand its digital offerings, though the deal is currently facing antitrust concerns. A potential FIS-Global Payments deal would've accelerated this trend and ultimately created a payments behemoth by merging the processing, merchant acquiring, ecommerce and omnichannel solutions, and POS offerings that both FIS and Global Payments encompass, leading to a reduction in market competition. Though it remains uncertain if merger negotiations will be revived, it's likely that a deal between the two firms might bring antitrust scrutiny, considering the size and scale of a potential combined entity.

2020-12-04,This banking-as-a-service fintech helping businesses embed payments tech into their apps just raised a $27 million Series A led Andreessen Horowitz,"Wade Arnold witnessed firsthand the challenges of combining new, online banking tools with older bank payment systems. While leading Banno, a fintech he founded in 2008, Arnold saw the difficulties that come with trying to upgrade tech at smaller banks and credit unions with limited resources.
After Banno's acquisition by banking tech Jack Henry in 2014, Arnold has gone on to create a new company that aims to solve some of those problems around how companies send, receive and store money on their apps.
Iowa-headquartered Moov is banking-as-a-service, helping businesses embed transactional banking tools — like the ability to send ACH payments — directly into their apps, all while being flexible (it can be used with different bank software, for example) and open-sourced (the code is freely available online). 
Read more:Meet the 38 fintechs that investors say are the next generation of breakout B2B stars. Here's who they think will follow in the footsteps of Plaid and Stripe.
On Friday, Moov announced the closing of a $27 million Series A round, led by Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, with participation from Gokul Rajaram, an executive at DoorDash, and prior investors. The cash raise comes on the back of a $5.5 million seed round in August that was led by Matt Harris at Bain Capital.
As part of the capital raise, Angela Strange, a general partner at a16z, will be joining Moov's board along with Harris.
""Capital comes in more ways than just cash,""Arnold told Business Insider of a16z's involvement in the fundraising. ""They bring a whole lot to the table.""
At a16z, Strange and general partner Peter Levine co-led the Moov deal, combining Strange's experience investing in financial services companies with Levine's knowledge of open-source technology communities.
Arnold said the infusion of capital will allow Moov to build out key client demands, like more methods for transfering funds, but in a methodical way. 
""As a payment provider, being sustainable is pretty darn important. That's what the capital allows us to do, to make that solid substrate, that solid foundation of these technologies, without taking shortcuts,"" said Arnold. 
Moov has ""such a deep understanding of this space,"" Strange said. Given Arnold's background since starting Banno, she continued, he ""has this rare technical brain that really understands the new and really understands the old, which is hard to find."" 
Strange declined to disclose Moov's valuation. 
The investments in Moov come at a time when the tech needs of a community bank are vastly different than that of an online bank like Chime, Arnold said.
""The old systems weren't designed for scale. The scale that comes with platforms puts a lot of pressure on systems that were designed for in-person service,"" he continued. As a result, there's often a mismatch between the seamless experience customers experience when they use an app to initiate a money transfer and what happens behind the scenes. 
Smaller banks have been forced to rethink their digital strategies this year as lockdowns from the pandemic have increased consumers' shift towards digital banking. 
See more: Digital-only banks have doubled their consumer bases and raised $4.6 billion in funding this year. Here's how startups like Chime, Dave, and Acorns are making big strides in 2020.
What differentiates Moov, in large part, is that the technology they create is open-source — meaning it's freely available to access online on the code-sharing website GitHub and open for discussion on their public Slack channel. But rather than encourage potential competitors, the approach has actually drawn backers, according to Arnold. 
""I think that's what got Andreessen Horowitz excited about this,"" he said. 
It was a sentiment echoed by Strange. Moov's open-source community creates a ""highly reliable, down to the core primitive building block,"" she said, since so many developers can contribute to the code.","Summary List PlacementWade Arnold witnessed firsthand the challenges of combining new, online banking tools with older bank payment systems.

2020-12-17,Intuit and Credit Karma's CEOs explain how combining credit and tax data on a 'massive' scale are key following the closure of the $8.1 billion deal between the two companies,"Credit Karma has long been known as the go-to for free credit scores. But since its founding in 2007, the startup has expanded its reach to create a more complete offering. It's since launched savings and checking accounts and a tax filing service for its more than 110 million users.
Its scale and reach proved attractive to Intuit, which announced plans to acquire Credit Karma in February.
On December 3rd, the acquisition closed, contingent on Credit Karma selling its tax offering to Square, which was a requirement of the deal following review by the Department of Justice. Credit Karma Tax had historically competed with Intuit's TurboTax.
The deal ultimately closed for $8.1 billion in cash and stock, $1 billion more than the initial price announced. The adjustment was due to an increase in Intuit's stock price this year and a working capital adjustment related to Credit Karma's value, including $300 million in cash on Credit Karma's balance sheet, a spokesperson told Business Insider.
Together, the companies could become an undeniable force in consumer finance. Credit Karma's store of consumer financial data is huge, as is Intuit's, which has over 50 million W-2s and 28 million 1099's.  
""The scale of what we have together is massive,"" Sasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit, told Business Insider. ""And in the last nine months, from the time of announcement to close, we've built all of the data pipes.""
Read more: Intuit is set to buy Credit Karma for $7.1 billion — here's what the TurboTax owner has to gain from the buzzy startup known for its free credit scores
Data will be key to their future plans.
The companies are looking to ""fundamentally transform how consumers achieve financial freedom,"" Goodarzi said. While Credit Karma will continue to run separate to Intuit, with cofounder and CEO Ken Lin staying on to run things, there will be plenty of overlap between the two sides. 
Lin said the deal has the potential to be viewed as a ""turning point"" for consumers a decade from now thanks to the ability for both companies to pool resources, data elements, and cutting-edge tech.
With more data, Intuit and Credit Karma can offer consumers optimized and cheaper financial products, saving them money and potentially putting pressure on incumbents who charge fees and higher interest rates.
""I think that will level the playing field so that some of the most underprivileged consumers have the same access to technology and products that some of the most wealthy and affluent consumers have,"" Lin added.
Intuit and Credit Karma will benefit from the scale of the new company
While the companies will continue to operate separately, they'll be able to share data and customer insights, taking advantage of each other's massive scale.
Banks and fintechs have evolved financial offerings and used new sets of data to make credit decisions, but consumers have been left behind, Lin said. As a result, the space has the potential to be transformed, he added.
By helping consumers understand which products they qualify for and why, Credit Karma aims to simplify consumers' financial lives. And it'll will be boosted by Intuit's consumer data.
""We now have the credit profile and the income and assets profile,"" Lin said. ""By the way, these are the data sets that banks are using to determine your eligibility. So now we have it for the consumer.""
With that data, Credit Karma can simplify historically complex and manual processes, like applying for credit and refinancing a mortgage. By proactively looking for more cost-effective credit and automating application processes, Credit Karma wants to change the way consumers overpay for financial products.
""Imagine how much better off the consumer will be in terms of cash flow, and in terms of the way they overpay for their financial services products,"" Lin said. ""That's where the industry is, and that's where we think we can bring consumers along.""
Read more: $7.1 billion Credit Karma is launching its first checking account, and execs think the new offering could be a key data source for recommending loans
Through Credit Karma Money, for example, Lin is focused on reinventing the checking account, offering an alternative to the fee-bearing accounts offered by traditional banks. And Intuit, which processes $300 billion in tax refunds every year, will only boost Credit Karma's reach.
""That is kind of how consumers stand to benefit. When you bring Intuit into the equation, you really turbo charge it,"" Lin said.
The two CEOs say the DOJ's antitrust review was thorough
As bright as the future looks for Intuit and Credit Karma, that's not to say there weren't bumps along the way.
Prior to approving the deal, the DOJ required that Credit Karma agree to sell its tax business to Square for $50 million. 
Credit Karma Tax, launched in 2017, gave the company insight into users' income data, in addition to their existing credit data. It was a powerful resource for Credit Karma's core business: recommending credit offerings.
And while they weren't initially expecting to sell Credit Karma Tax, the CEOs said they understood, and weren't going to delay the deal on that condition.
""It's certainly not what we were anticipating when we started the deal, but we also went into it with eyes wide open, knowing that we really had to think about every contingency of what the DOJ is going to require and we have to be thoughtful,"" Lin said.
Read more:Plaid has been quietly building a new payments tool and Visa wants to buy it to squash competition, US antitrust regulators say
The DOJ was primarily concerned with what this deal means for consumers, looking at how it would impact competition in the space, Goodarzi said. Generally, the two CEOs say that the antitrust process was a positive experience, which they said was thoughtful and thorough.
While the DOJ has recently approved other fintech deals, like Mastercard's acquisition of data aggregator Finicity, deals like Visa's acquisition of Plaid have come under antitrust scrutiny.
""We didn't want to get stuck here with the DOJ,"" Lin said.

2021-01-13,"Dow Jones Edges Higher as Intel Picks New CEO, Visa Abandons Plaid Acquisition","The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up about 0.2% at 1 p.m. EST Wednesday as the U.S. House of Representatives debated a historic second impeachment of President Donald Trump. The impeachment effort will likely draw some Republican support.
The Dow rose despite a record 4,400 U.S. deaths reported for Tuesday attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. While effective vaccines should eventually put an end to the pandemic, the situation could get a lot worse before it gets better.
Turning to individual stocks, shares of Intel(NASDAQ:INTC) rose after the company announced that it was replacing its CEO, while shares of Visa(NYSE:V) edged higher even after its acquisition of fintech company Plaid fell apart.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel to replace CEO
Chip giant Intel has fallen behind competitors on multiple fronts. The company has watched as rival Advanced Micro Devices staged a comeback, stealing share in the desktop, laptop, and server CPU markets. Manufacturing stumbles have been part of the problem: Intel has faced chronic delays, and the company no longer has any sort of technological edge over third-party foundries.
Intel announced on Wednesday that CEO Bob Swan was stepping down effective Feb. 15. Swan will be replaced by Pat Gelsinger, the current CEO of virtualization software provider VMware. This move comes just weeks after activist investor Daniel Loeb called for Intel to make big changes, including potentially spinning off its manufacturing operations.
Intel said the CEO change was unrelated to the company's 2020 financial performance. The company also said that it expects to exceed its guidance for fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share and that it will provide an update on its delayed 7nm process technology when it reports its results on Jan. 21.
The management shuffle was welcomed by investors, who sent the stock up about 7.5% by early Wednesday afternoon. Intel stock has languished over the past year due to a variety of factors, including the manufacturing stumbles, a resurgent AMD, and the prospect of ARM-based server chips going mainstream, driven by the pending acquisition of ARM Holdings by NVIDIA.
Even factoring in Wednesday's rally, Intel stock is still down slightly over the past year.
Visa gives up on acquiring Plaid
Credit card giant Visa has abandoned its efforts to acquire fintech company Plaid. Visa announced on Tuesday that the two companies had mutually agreed to terminate the merger agreement. Visa originally announced the $5.3 billion deal in January of 2020.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block Visa's acquisition of Plaid in November, filing a civil antitrust suit alleging that Visa was making the acquisition to protect its lucrative debit business. The DOJ said that Plaid was developing a payments platform that would challenge Visa's debit monopoly and that Visa was trying to buy the company to eliminate a potential competitive threat.
Plaid allows apps to connect to consumers' bank accounts. The company's technology powers many fintech apps, making it a leading financial data-aggregation company. The DOJ's lawsuit contends that a money-movement platform offered by Plaid could leverage its existing technology and bank account connections and allow it to disrupt Visa's monopoly.
Visa believes it would have prevailed in court, but the company said it was dropping the effort because a ""protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.""
Shares of Visa were up about 0.8% by early Wednesday afternoon. While investors don't seem to mind that the acquisition fell apart, an eventual disruption of Visa's debit business could hurt the stock down the road.","Intel will get new leadership next month as it faces major challenges, and Visa will no longer acquire Plaid."

This story originally appeared on StockNewsRobinhood has been the most used platform by Millennials for stock trading due to its zero-commissions policy. As more and more Millennials are starting to take an active interest in the stock markets, the Robinhood platform has climbed to more than 13 million users. This can be attributed to the rallying stock market over the last two quarters despite economic weakness. With rising rates of unemployment and remote working freeing up more screen time, a large proportion of millennials have taken up active trading.
It should be no surprise that the tech savvy generation has taken a liking to some of the biggest tech stocks in the world. While many investors are shifting their focus to outdoor stocks in light of recent coronavirus vaccine approval and a potential broad rollout of vaccinations very soon, Millennials have been taking advantage of the market dip because  they expect the prices to rebound in the foreseeable future.
While the vaccine’s development did lead to a tech sell-off last month, analysts expect big names in this sector to recover quickly as the services offered by these companies are likely to remain in demand.

As the largest e-commerce company in the world, AMZN has been one of the biggest gainers in the pandemic. With average trading volume of 4.82 million, AMZN is the fourth most actively traded stock on the Robinhood 100 list.
Despite gaining 67.8% year-to-date, analysts expect AMZN to move higher over the coming months. This is due mainly to a rampant second wave of coronavirus infections that has hit most countries around the world. Analysts expect AMZN’s price to reach $3830.49, indicating a 20.2% rise from the current price.
This comes in despite the current antitrust charges levied against the company by the US government and European Union because the company has been implementing an ambitious expansion strategy to increase its market reach. AMZN is currently building multiple fulfilment centers across the country, as well as developing its cloud services segment (AWS). As the demand for cloud services continues to rise amid the remote working and learning culture, AWS has emerged as one of the top three largest cloud computing companies and is poised to expand further into the Indian and European markets.
AMZN launched Amazon Pharmacy for online prescription medication sales on November 19. The online drug sales e-commerce platform delivers several savings benefits, with up to 80% savings on no-prescription medication. With a second wave of COVID-19 raging across the US, coupled with high unemployment, AMZN pharmacies should witness high demand as people order medication online to garner savings while remaining socially distant.
AMZN’s net sales have increased 37% year-over-year to $96.10 billion in the third quarter ended September 30.Net income grew 200% from the year-ago value to $6.30 billion, while EPS rose 192.4% from the same period last year to $12.37.
The consensus EPS estimate of $7.09 for the quarter ending December 31 represents a 9.6% rise year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history; it beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. The consensus revenue estimate of $119.44 billion for the current quarter represents a 36.6% rise from the year-ago value. AMZN gained more than 115% to hit its 52-week high of $3,552.25 in September since hitting its 52-week low of $1626.03 in March.
How does AMZN stack up for the POWR Ratings?

The stock is currently ranked #17 out of 59 stocks in the Internet industry.
Visa, Inc. (V - Get Rating)
V is one of the largest global financial payments processing companies in the world. It has been thriving in the pandemic. As the demand for online transactions have increased significantly under the lockdown, customers and merchants have adopted virtual payments across the globe. V’s position as the largest commercial payments card network has made it one of the most actively traded stocks in the US, with an average trading volume of 7.89 million. It is currently ranked #18 in the Robinhood 100 list.
With the technological advancements currently underway, most developed countries have become virtually cash free, while developing and underdeveloped parts of the world are witnessing a significant rise in the digital transactions volume. With many countries now developing and testing their digital currencies, V’s industry knowledge as the leading payment processor is key in facilitating international transactions through this means.
Analysts expect V’s price to rise 8.15% to $225 in the near future. The company’s recent acquisition of YellowPepper and Plaid contributes heavily to this bullish expectation because it allows V to strengthen its position as a global industry leader. On November 23, the company entered a strategic partnership with Visa Commercial Pay to streamline transactions in the B2B segment. This should bring in a higher volume of customers for V, as most businesses are currently operating remotely.
V’s payments volume and processed transactions increased 4% and 3% year-over-year, respectively, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30. Revenue from the data processing segment rose 4% versus the same period last year to $2.88 billion, while revenue from the “Other” segment grew 5% from its year-ago value to $361 million.
The consensus EPS estimate of $5.45 for the current year represents an 8.1% rise year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history as well; it beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the railing four quarters. The consensus revenue estimate of $23.22 billion for the current year indicates a 6.3% rise from the same period last year. V has gained more than 50% since hitting its 52-week low of $133.93 in March.
It is no surprise that V is rated “Strong Buy” in our proprietary POWR ratings system, with an “A” for Trade Grade and “Buy &amp; Hold Grade, and “B” for Peer Grade and Industry Rank. In the 96-stock Consumer Financial Services industry, V is currently ranked #1.
Sony Corporation (SNE - Get Rating)
SNE operates in multiple segments in the virtual entertainment industry –from developing hardware such as television, cameras and play stations to designing and producing gaming software, motion pictures and music. Based in Japan, SNE has become a household name in most parts of the world. The company is the fifth most actively traded stock on the Robinhood platform, with an average trading volume of 1.09 million.
Analysts expect SNE to gain 7.3% to hit $100.65. The company’s diversified product range and international market reach makes it well positioned to grow despite macroeconomic factors because it enjoys substantial brand loyalty. The company launched PlayStation 5 in November, which has already proven to be a big hit. It is currently working on the Airpeak project, which designs and manufactures drones for commercial purposes. This, coupled with its recent acquisitions of anime developer Ellation Holdings and media production company Nevion, should drive the business to new highs.
SNE’s operating income rose 14% year-over-year to ¥317.80 billion in the fiscal second quarter ended September 30. Its adjusted EBIT grew 14% from the same period last year to ¥299.60 billion, while net income increased 145% from the year-ago value to ¥459.60 billion.
The consensus EPS estimate of $0.31 for the next quarter ending March 31, 2021 indicates a 210% rise year-over-year. Moreover, SNE beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, which bodes well for the stock. The consensus revenue estimate of $19.10 billion for the next quarter indicates a 21.4% rise from the same period last year.
SNE has gained more than 85% since hitting its 52-week low of $50.94 in March. The stock hit its 52-week high of $94.97 earlier today.
SNE is rated “Strong Buy” in our POWR Ratings system, with an “A” for Trade Grade, Buy &amp; Hold Grade and Peer Grade, and “B” for Industry Rank. It is currently ranked #1 of 21 stocks in the Entertainment – Media Producers industry.

2020-12-02,A startup that's taking a SaaS approach to selling digital-banking tech just nabbed $81 million from Goldman Sachs and other backers,"To compete as a consumer bank is an uphill battle. Startups looking to upend traditional banking face significant barriers to entry — for one, a high cost of capital — even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to accelerate industry-wide transitions to digital banking.
It's a strength, then, that Amount's strategy is to help traditional banks digitize their consumer offerings, not supplant them with alternatives. Spun off from online lender Avant in February, Chicago-based Amount works with banks to help them speed up digital transformations. 
The startup overlays its software onto existing bank infrastructure to help firms update credit cards, point-of-sale offerings and fraud prevention tools, among others. 
On Wednesday, the company announced the closing of an $81 million Series C fundraising round, led by Goldman Sachs' growth equity team, GS Growth. Previous investors August Capital, Invus Opportunities, and Hanaco Ventures also participated in the round.
The latest cash raise follows a $58 million Series B round in March led by QED Investors' Nigel Morris, who was a cofounder of Capital One and spent 10 years as its president and chief operating officer.
""We really feel like we have world-class investors behind us,"" Amount CEO Adam Hughes told Business Insider.
New capital will go to ""significant investments in R&amp;D,"" said Hughes, who previously served as COO and president of Avant, while also helping build out the company's implementations team and doubling the size of its sales efforts.
Additionally, any potential cash left over could be used for acquisition opportunities and an expansion into new asset classes — like mortgages or small business lending — over the next six months, Hughes said.
The startup was valued at $600 million prior to the raise, he added.
""Making sure that we can keep up with that demand both from existing customers and new customers is a big focus point of mine,"" Hughes said.
Amount is the product of seven years of development inside Avant
The legacy of Amount's core technology — developed over seven years at Avant — was a key selling point for Goldman, Jade Mandel, a vice president at GS Growth, told Business Insider via email.
""We were impressed by the team's deep domain expertise and appreciation for the complexity of the financial products in question,"" said Mandel, who will be taking a seat on Amount's board.
The decision to spin Amount out from Avant, which was established in 2012 and has connected over 800,000 customers to $6.5 billion in loans, came after a realization that there was wider market for helping traditional firms quickly digitize their services. 
""We found that the technology we had built at Avant was really not Avant-specific. We quickly recognized this was a massive, standalone SaaS business,"" Hughes said.

So-called challenger bankers have been hot on the heels of traditional banks in recent years. That trend has only gained steam with the rise in digital banking due to the coronavirus. 
Larger banks, however, have sometimes struggled to keep pace with their smaller, more agile competitors due to the older technology they still maintain, which requires constant updates and isn't easily upgraded. 
Amount saw big interest in buy now, pay later
One area Amount has seen particular success is tapping into the buy now, pay later frenzy.
Also referred to as point-of-sale financing, customers are able to pay for a purchase in installments as opposed to using a credit card. The trend has gained traction in 2020, with companies like Affirm and Klarna seeking to capitalize on broader consumer shifts to online shopping and younger generations' hesitancy to use credit cards.

Earlier this year, Amount released its own buy now, pay later offering. It's been well received, with TD Bank as one notable client. Amount powers the bank's point-of-sale financing on the websites of companies like Nordic Track, the exercise machine manufacturer.
""That's probably the product we've seen the most traction with this year,"" Hughes said. ""We identified that as a major opportunity over a year ago. We rolled out the product and we think it's very much on par with the other fintechs.""
Amount's other bank partners include HSBC and BBVA, among others. Together, their market share represents more than 50 million U.S. customers. As Amount looks to further grow its customer base, Hughes said they will focus on the largest 250 banks in the US.","Summary List PlacementTo compete as a consumer bank is an uphill battle.

2021-01-12,Visa Drops Plans To Acquire Fintech Startup Plaid After DOJ Antitrust Lawsuit,"Visa and fintech startup Plaid ditched plans for a $5.3 billion merger Tuesday after a Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit had threatened to block the deal. 
Plaid CEO Zach Perret
© KEVIN HU
Key Facts
Visa CEO Al Kelly said in a statement he believes the companies would have prevailed in court, but protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.
Antitrust regulators argued Visas acquisition of Plaid would eliminate a nascent competitor offering a lower-cost option for online debit payments and deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa and increase entry barriers for future innovators.
Crucial Quote
 While Plaid and Visa would have been a great combination, we have decided to instead work with Visa as an investor and partner so we can fully focus on building the infrastructure to support fintech, Plaid CEO Zach Perret said in a statement.
Key Background
Plaid is a San Francisco fintech upstart used by popular financial apps like Venmo, Robinhood and Square Cash to connect users to their bank accounts. One key reason Visa was interested in buying Plaid was to access the apps growing customer base and sell them more services. Over the past year, Plaid says it has grown its customer base to 4,000 companies, up 60% from a year ago.
This is a developing story.",The companies said antitrust litigation would likely take too much time to resolve.
2021-01-14,What’s Next For Fintech Infrastructure After Visa And Plaid Call It Off,"One year later, Visa and Plaid mutually terminate $5.3 billion merger
SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
The pandemic is an inflection point in fintechs lifecycle, pushing adoption and application capacity beyond the mainstream customers expectations. Many of these financial apps rely on infrastructure including Plaids financial data aggregation via APIs and webhooks, to build these digital financial services. Though the $5.3 billion merger agreement between Plaid and Visa 
 V
 was mutually terminated under pressure from the Department of Justices investigation, the market opportunity has grown substantially as fintech apps crossed over from targeted niche services to mass market adoption. 
Fintech companies already had significant upward growth opportunities across banking, consumer payments, and lending, among other verticals. In January 2020 when the merger was announced, Plaid only captured a single-digit market share of each target vertical, or approximately 3.5% of the $3.15 billion combined addressable opportunity in North America, based on Visa and Plaids supporting materials. 
Visa Investor Relations
Amid lockdowns, verticals including digital banking and investing saw adoption rates surge. Challenger banks had an edge in onboarding customers fully-remote versus incumbents that rely on branches for customer acquisition. Meanwhile, brokerages and investing apps were well-positioned among consumers with extra time at home and savings from slashing expenses on travel and entertainment. Post pandemic, the open question is how much of the shift in consumer behavior from physical to digital channels will be permanent.
As the connective tissue between consumer apps and banks, infrastructure providers, including Plaid, benefit from an increase in volume from account openings, connections, and active usage driving higher API call volumes. Plaid reportedly grew customers by 60% to over 4,000 companies. Other API providers in the mix include MX which, powers approximately 2,000 banks, credit unions, and fintech companies and reaches 200 million consumers. MX announced closing a $300 million Series C investment at a $1.9 billion valuation, one day after Visa and Plaid called off the merger. For perspective, a year ago, Plaid had connected 200 million user accounts and had a $2.7B valuation following its $250 million Series C in December 2018. 
While the landscape is more competitive, 2020 also revealed gaps in financial infrastructure. One prominent example is how the governments stimulus checks were mishandled and that millions were distributed to deceased individuals or failed to clear because the destination bank accounts had been closed. Challenger banks were quick to step up with a short-term solution to front customers the funds. However, the longer-term solution lies in the financial plumbing, Plaids specialty, and by remaining independent, is free to build alternatives to traditional card payment schemes.","Though the $5.3 billion merger agreement between Plaid and Visa was mutually terminated under pressure from the Department of Justice’s investigation, the market opportunity has grown substantially as fintech apps crossed over from targeted niche services to …"
2021-01-14,American trustbusters force Visa to back off Plaid,"IN EARLY2019 an executive at Visa, a giant payments firm, sketched a picture of an island volcano. He scribbled the current capabilities of Plaid, a Silicon Valley fintech firm founded in 2012, in the tip showing above the water. The startup, which has developed a platform connecting consumer accounts at more than 11,000 banks to financial apps, was offering services like bank connections, account validation and asset confirmation. But he warned of the massive opportunity beneath the surface. Plaid could expand into fraud detection, making credit decisions and, scariest of all, payments infrastructure.
This opportunity for Plaid looked like a threat to Visa. Ten months later, in January 2020, Visa announced that it would acquire its putative rival for $5.3bn. This sum was more than 50 times the revenue Plaid earned in 2019 (though a modest lift for a company with a market capitalisation of over $460bn). Al Kelly, Visas boss, described the deal as an insurance policy. 
These detailsvolcano sketch and allwere included in the complaint Americas Department of Justice filed in November, when it sued to block the deal. The acquisition, the DoJ said, would snuff out a competitor in the debit-card business, in which Visa has a market share of around 70% and profit margins nudging 90%. In 2019 Visa earned around $4bn in profits. On January 12th the DoJ announced that Visa had pulled out of the deal, rather than continue to trial, which was scheduled for June. 
The trustbusters intervention bears some striking similarities to the antitrust suits that have been filed against Facebook. Two separate legal challenges, one mounted by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys-general in 46 states and another from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), centre on its acquisitions. They alleged that the technology titan maintained its monopoly in personal social-networking by systematically buying up potential competitorsnotably Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. 
In its defence, Facebook said that the government now wants a do-over, which would, as the company has put it, send a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final. The FTCs complaint fails to mention that the antitrust authorities cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp deals at the time.
The move to block the tie-up of Visa and Plaid implies a new trustbusting approach taking shape in America. Henceforth the authorities will probably try to nip Facebook-like arguments in the bud pre-emptively by stymieing attempts by powerful incumbents to swallow upstart competitors. Explosive stuff.

2020-12-10,Visa Wants to Buy Plaid. U.S. Sues,"In January 2020, Visa announced it was acquiring Plaid for $5.3 billion. Perhaps because of the size of the transaction, or perhaps because Visa was acquiring a well-known and innovative technology company, the announcement was accompanied by much fanfare.
Before long, however, the U.S. Department of Justice began scrutinizing the transaction, resulting in the filing of an antitrust lawsuit to stop it.
This article will describe Plaid and explain why the Department of Justice is attempting to block the deal.
What Is Plaid?
Plaid provides the technical integrations for a huge variety of apps to communicate with financial institutions. It is an enabler of open banking via APIs. Consumers can make and receive payments, view account balances and transaction history, and more. Using Plaid, developers can quickly and securely connect their apps with financial institutions, which used to take months, sometimes years.
If you’ve paid a bill from your bank account via an app or website, Plaids technology was likely involved. Venmo, Stripe, TransferWise, Robinhood, and Coinbase are a few of the reported 11,000 financial institutions (with 200 million consumer accounts) that connect to Plaid.
Plaid was founded in 2013. It has secured roughly $300 million in venture capital. Interestingly, both Visa and Mastercard were early but silent investors. And the $5.3 billion price that it offered for the company precisely double Plaids valuation at the time indicates Visa’s strong motivation.
Plaid has access to a vast amount of consumer data. According to the Department of Justice, Plaid has become the leading financial data aggregation company in the United States. Its fair to call Plaid the Google of financial data.
Why Acquire?
Shortly after the January announcement, Visa CEO Al Kelly said the deal would position Visa for the next decade. It will help expand the companys own total addressable market and relationships with fintech companies, as well as boost Plaids growth.
In other words, the intent was to increase Visas presence in the financial technology sector and to increase profits.
DOJ’s Case
The Department of Justice believes the result would restrict competition. What follows is a summary of the DOJs case. No court date has been set, incidentally.
Visa is already a monopoly. The DOJ claims that Visa has become a monopoly in online debit-payment processing. Plaid, according to the DOJ, has developed technology that would challenge this debit monopoly.
Plaid was planning to use its technology together with its 11,000 banking connections to build a bank-linked payment network that would compete with Visas payment processing and debit business.”
According to the Justice Department:
<ul><li>Plaids money movement platform would allow consumers to pay merchants directly from their bank accounts using bank credentials rather than a debit card.</li></ul><ul><li>Plaids established connections and technology uniquely positions it to enter the payments market and disrupt Visas monopoly.</li></ul>Visa is restricting competition. Visa is attempting to acquire Plaid to stifle a burgeoning competitor that threatens the billions of dollars in fees that Visa charges merchants and consumers to process debit payments.
Visa is protecting debit-card revenue. Visa considers the acquisition as an insurance policy to protect its debit card business. Indeed, according to internal communications, Visas CEO said that if it did not acquire Plaid, Visa may be forced to accept lower margins or not have a competitive offering.
Visa’s Response
Visa’s short statement in response to the lawsuit stated, in part, Plaid is not a payments company. Visas business faces intense competition from a variety of players but Plaid is not one of them.","In January 2020, Visa announced it was acquiring Plaid for $5.3 billion.

""Cravath's hallmark is working on high-impact transactions and litigation,"" said Faiza Saeed, the firm's presiding partner who leads the firm's strategy and direction. ""They're very transformative cases. They're critical in that moment to add scale to the business, like Disney's combining with 21st Century Fox, or critical to future business, as is the case with Epic Games' ongoing lawsuits against Apple and Google or PG&amp;E's bankruptcy."" 
Many of Cravath's cases — with clients from media powerhouses like Time Warner to tech giants like Silicon Valley's Tesla — are so large that they often pull in multiple partners from various specialties.
Cravath has topped Vault's list of national law firms five years in a row, and The American Lawyer ranked it the eighth most profitable firm, with $4.4 million in profits per equity partner, the average of which was $1.7 million among the Global 100.
This is despite the fact that the firm runs a tight ship. Under the Cravath System, pioneered by the firm's founder, Paul Cravath, the firm hires top talent from law schools, pays them compensation based on seniority, provides them with high-caliber training, and promotes partners almost exclusively from its associates. The firm rarely hires lateral partners and has kept its attorney head count relatively low, with about 560 lawyers, 90 of which are partners, according to the firm.
The intense focus the firm places on attracting and cultivating talent from within plays an instrumental role in its success.
The firm's generalist, collaborative nature arises in part from its rotation system, where associates switch between different partners within a department. And because lawyers are rewarded for the firm's success as a whole under its compensation model, they're ""incentivized to win as a team,"" and partners are willing to dive into matters they might not have originated themselves, Saeed said.
Now that it's weathered the pandemic in the past months, Saeed said the firm's work was likely to only grow: ""In the near term, we are beginning to see a rebound in strategic M&amp;A, which we expect to continue. Financing and restructuring work remain in high demand. And while the landscape for litigation has changed in the virtual environment, our litigators are preparing for high-profile, consequential trials in 2021.""

2021-01-12,Visa abandons $5.3B Plaid acquisition in the face of DoJ antitrust suit,"The U.S. Department of Justice sees a victory in a major fintech acquisition case that could set the stage for a host of antitrust enforcements.
On Jan. 12, the DoJ announced that Visa and Plaid had called it quits on their planned merger. Originally announced almost exactly a year ago, Visa was planning to pay $5.3 billion for the upstart tech firm. 
Plaid's ubiquitous software is designed to connect disparate systems of financial data securely. In its November complaint, the DoJ alleged that Visa was using the acquisition to snuff out competition. Today, Makan Delrahim, of the DoJ's antitrust division, said:
""Visa which has immense power in online debit in the United States has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions. Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visas online debit services. With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.
Tech in general has been at the center of turbulent debates over antitrust violations. Shortly before its case against Visa, the DoJ filed an antitrust suit against Google. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is suing Facebook. 
In both cases, the governing bodies argue that the platforms used their access to competitor data and ability to direct buyer traffic to corner the market. But U.S. antitrust mostly derives from the 1890 Sherman Act, which hardly anticipated data becoming the new oil, when oil had not even become the new oil. Meanwhile, for the past two decades, major tech platforms have been the wunderkinder of the American economy, leaving most public officials hesitant to slow their roll. 
That special status has come under fire of late, especially since 2016. What we're witnessing now is a major rearmament of the U.S. antitrust apparatus for a new age.",Visa backs down from Plaid acquisition as DoJ braces for new era of trust-busting.

2021-01-12,Daily Crunch: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition,"Markets ended 2020 on a high note, and have started 2021 on a bullish trajectory. All three major indexes have recently surged to all-time highs as investors seemingly looked beyond the pandemic and hoped for signs of a rapid recovery. Veteran strategist Edward Yardeni sees the economic recovery bringing its own slowdown with it. As the COVID vaccination program allows for further economic opening, with more people getting back to work, Yardeni predicts a wave of pent-up demand, increasing wages, and rising prices in short, a recipe for inflation. In the second half of the year we may be on the lookout for some consumer price inflation which would not be good for overvalued assets, Yardeni noted.The warning sign to look for is higher yields in the Treasury bond market. If the Fed eases up on the low-rate policy, Yardeni sees Treasuries reflecting the change first.A situation like this is tailor-made for defensive stock plays and that will naturally bring investors to look at high-yield dividend stocks. Opening up the TipRanks database, weve found three stocks featuring a hat trick of positive signs: A Strong Buy rating, dividend yields starting at 9% or better and a recent analyst review pointing toward double-digit upside.CTO Realty Growth (CTO)We'll start with CTO Realty Growth, a Florida-based real estate company that, last year, made an exciting decision for dividend investors: the company announced that it would change its tax status to that of a real estate investment trust (REIT) for the tax year ending December 31, 2020. REITs have long been known for their high dividend yields, a product of tax code requirements that these companies return a high percentage of their profits directly to shareholders. Dividends are usual route of that return.For background, CTO holds a varied portfolio of real estate investments. The holdings include 27 income properties in 11 states, totaling more than 2.4 million square feet, along with 18 leasable billboards in Florida. The income properties are mainly shopping centers and retail outlets. During the third quarter, the most recent reported, CTO sold off some 3,300 acres of undeveloped land for $46 million, acquired two income properties for $47.9 million, and collected ~93% of contractual base rents due. The company also authorized a one-time special distribution, in connection with its shift to REIT status; its purpose was to put the company in compliance with income return regulation during tax year 2020. The one-time distribution was made in cash and stock, and totaled $11.83 per share.The regular dividend paid in Q3 was 40 cents per common share. That was increased in Q4 to $1, a jump of 150%; again, this was done to put the company in compliance with REIT-status requirements. At the current dividend rate, the yield is 9.5%, far higher than the average among financial sector peer companies.Analyst Craig Kucera, of B. Riley, believes that CTO has plenty of options going forward to expand its portfolio through acquisition: CTO hit the high end of anticipated disposition guidance at $33M in 4Q20, bringing YTD dispositions to nearly $85M, with the largest disposition affiliated with the exercise of a tenant's option to purchase a building from CTO in Aspen, CO. Post these dispositions, we estimate &gt;$30M in cash and restricted cash for additional acquisitions, and we expect CTO to be active again in 1H21.To this end, Kucera rates CTO a Buy along with a $67 price target. At current levels, his target implies a 60% one-year upside potential. (To watch Kuceras track record, click here)Overall, CTO has 3 reviews on record from Wall Streets analysts, and they all agree that this stock is a Buy, making the analyst consensus of Strong Buy unanimous. The shares are priced at $41.85, and their average price target of $59.33 suggests room for ~42% growth in the year ahead. (See CTO stock analysis on TipRanks)Holly Energy Partners (HEP)The energy sector, with its high cash flows, is also known for its high-paying dividend stocks. Holly Energy Partners is a midstream transportation player in sector, providing pipeline, terminal, and storage services for producers of crude oil and petroleum distillate products. Holly bases most of its operations in the Colorado-Utah and New Mexico-Texas-Oklahoma regions. In 2019, the last full year for which numbers are available, the company saw $533 million in total revenues.The companys revenues in 2020 slipped in the first and second quarters, but rebounded in Q3, coming in at $127.7 million. Holly reported at distributable cash flow from which dividends are paid of $76.9 million, up more than $8 million year-over-year. This supported a 35-cent dividend payment per regular share, or $1.40 annualized. At that rate, the dividend yields a strong 10%.Noting the dividend, Well Fargo analyst Michael Blum wrote, Our model suggests the distribution is sustainable at this level as [lost revenue] is offset by inflation escalators in HEP's pipeline contracts and contributions from the Cushing Connect JV project. About 80% of HEP's distribution is tax-deferred.Blum gives HEP a $20 price target and an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating. His target implies a 38% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Blums track record, click here)""Our rating primarily reflects the partnership's steady, fee-based cash flows, robust yield and conservative balance sheet, Blum added.For the most part, Wall Street agrees with Blums assessment on HEP, as shown by the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. That rating is supported by 6 reviews, split 5 to 1 Buys versus Hold. The average price target, at $18.67, suggests that the stock has room to grow ~29% this year. (See HEP stock analysis on TipRanks)DHT Holdings (DHT)Midstreaming is only one part of the global oil industrys transport network. Tankers are another, moving crude oil, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas around the world, in bulk. Bermuda-based DHT operates a fleet of 27 crude oil tankers, all rated VLCC (very large crude carrier). These vessels are 100% owned by the company, and range in tonnage from 298K to 320K. VLCCs are the workhorses of the global oil tanker network.After four quarters of sequential revenue gains, even through the corona half of 1H20, DHT posted a sequential drop in revenues from 2Q20 to 3Q20. The top line that quarter fell from $245 million to $142 million. Its important to note, however, that the 3Q revenue result was still up 36.5% year-over-year. EPS, at 32 cents, was a dramatic yoy turnaround from the 6-cent loss posted in 3Q19.DHT has a history of adjusting its dividend, when needed, to keep it in line with earnings. The company did that in Q3, and the 20-cent per regular share payment was the first dividend cut in 5 quarters. The general policy is a positive for dividend investors, however, as the company has not missed a dividend payment in 43 consecutive quarters an admirable record. At 80 cents per share annualized, the dividend yields an impressive 14%.Kepler analyst Petter Haugen covers DHT, and he sees potential for increased returns in the companys contract schedule. Haugen noted, With 8 out of 16 vessels ending their TC contracts by end Q1 2021, we believe DHT is well positioned for when we expect freight rates to appreciate in H2 2021E.Getting into more details, Haugen adds, [The] main underlying drivers are still intact: fleet growth will be low (1% on average over 2020- 23E) and the US will still end up being a net seaborne exporter of crude oil, making further export growth from the US drive tanker demand. We expect spot rates to improve again during 2021E, shortly after oil demand has normalised. We expect average VLCC rates of USD41,000/day in 2022E and USD55,000/day in 2023E.In line with his comments, Haugen rates DHT a Buy. His $7.40 target price suggests that this stock can grow 34% in the months ahead. (To watch Haugens track record, click here)The rest of the Street is getting onboard. 3 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. In addition, the $6.13 average price target puts the potential upside at ~11%.

2020-12-22,The 2020 Stratechery Year in Review,"From the beginning of Stratechery I have posited that writing about tech is a way to write about everything, given the way in which the Internet is affecting every part of society. The pandemic of 2020 has put this thesis on steroids: the lasting impact of COVID will be not entirely new ways of living, but rather the dramatic acceleration of trends that were already in place, particularly those enabled by technology. This includes real world issues like working-from-home, and new digital question raised by the sheer quantity of information, much of it wrong, but some very right.
Stratechery explored all of these issues this year, in both 44 Weekly Articles and 141 Daily Updates (including 18 Daily Update Interviews).
This was also an exciting year for new product launches: in February Stratechery launched The Stratechery Podcast which lets you consume Stratechery in your favorite podcast player. Then, in May, I launched Dithering, a thrice-weekly 15 minutes podcast, with Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber.
Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year on Stratechery.
You can find previous years here: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013
Here is the 2020 list.
The Five Most-Viewed Articles
The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:
<ol><li>The TikTok War How TikTok exposed Facebooks blindspot, thanks to its Chinese roots, and why those Chinese roots make TikTok a genuine concern. See also this Daily Update comparing TikTok to Quibi, and this Daily Update about how the TikTok ban went wrong.</li><li>The End of OS X OS X is retired, but fortunately, its legacy appears to live on in macOS 11.0.</li><li>The Anti-Amazon Alliance Google Shopping is changing its model, suggesting Google is joining the Anti-Amazon Alliance; 3rd-party merchants should do the same.</li><li>India, Jio, and the Four Internets There are four Internets: China versus the U.S., and the E.U. and India. Indias potential new model rests on Jio. See also this Daily Update about how Jio’s success shows why Facebook Free Basics was the wrong approach.</li><li>The Slack Social Network Slack lost to Microsoft head-to-head, but has shifted to a horizontal strategy that the vertically-oriented Microsoft cant match. See also this Daily Update about Salesforce’s acquisition of Slack.</li></ol>
Coronavirus and Information
The dominant story of 2020 was obviously COVID, but what was particularly interesting from a tech perspective were the debates about surfacing new information while battling misinformation. Notably, the first four articles were a sort of miniseries published in March; the final article discussed the same issues in the context of the election.
<ul><li>Zero Trust Information Zero Trust Networking is security with Internet assumptions; there is tremendous value if we apply the same approach to information.</li><li>Defining Information In a follow-up to Zero Trust Information, exploring the four types of information and how their value changes with time.</li><li>Compaq and Coronavirus Compaqs descent from a company of action to a brand is a frightening parable for the the Wests focus on talk over action.</li><li>Unmasking Twitter Twitter has a new policy to listen to experts about what content to limit; what happens, though, when experts are wrong?</li><li>Twitter, Responsibility, and Accountability Twitter has a new policy to listen to experts about what content to limit; what happens, though, when experts are wrong?</li></ul>
The Big Picture
These are the articles where writing about tech means writing about the world broadly; this has never been more true than in 2020, particularly given that we are at The End of the Beginning.
<ul><li>The End of the Beginning The beginning of technology was about the shift from batched computing in one place to continuous computing everywhere. That era of paradigm changes may be over, which means the real changes are only beginning. See also this Daily Update which discussed The End of the Beginning in the context of Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital.</li><li>Coronavirus Clarity The coronavirus crisis is making clear just how powerful tech companies are; hopefully this leads to a much more productive conversation about how that power should be utilized or regulated. See also How Tech Can Build, about Marc Andreessen’s seminal essay.</li><li>Chips and Geopolitics TSMC showed the power of modularization, and now they are core to the U.S. national security strategy. See also this Daily Update about TSMC, Intel, and U.S. national security.</li><li>Dust in the Light The Internet ends gatekeepers and increases transparency, which has world-altering effects both good and bad.</li><li>Social Networking 2.0 Facebook and Twitter represent the v1 of Social Networking; its a bad copy of the analog world, whereas v2 is something unique to digital, and a lot more promising. See also this Daily Update about how Facebook failed to build a social media platform.</li></ul>
Niches and Direct-to-Consumer
While Stratechery frequently discusses Aggregation Theory, a major focus in 2020 were companies and platforms that go direct-to-consumer by focusing on niches.
Antitrust, Regulation, and the App Store
One month after writing Aggregation Theory I noted that regulation was inevitable; that inevitable moment arrived in a big way in 2020, with Congressional hearings, reports, and multiple antitrust lawsuits. Apple also received unprecedented attention for its control of the App Store; both were big topics on Stratechery:
<ul><li>First, Do No Harm As regulators look closer at acquisitions they should be extremely wary of unintended consequences. The current system works well for everyone, most of the time.</li><li>Antitrust Politics and Anti-Monopoly vs. Antitrust focus on the antitrust subcommittee hearing with big tech executives, and the report that followed. See also this Daily Update for the questions Congress should have asked.</li><li>United States v. Google The Justice Departments lawsuit against Google is appropriately narrow, and if it fails it gives a template for Congressional action. See also Is the Internet Different?, which draws direct connections between Aggregation Theory and my views on antitrust.</li><li>Apple and Facebook and Privacy Labels and Lookalike Audiences focus on the sharpening dispute between Apple and Facebook, which, despite their differences, are more dependent on each other than Apple in particular realizes. See also this Daily Update about the FTC’s lawsuit against Facebook.</li><li>Apple, Epic, and the App Store explained how Apple leveraged its integration to control the App Store, while Rethinking the App Store tried to figure out a better approach that Apple might actually implement.</li></ul>
Five Companies
Stratechery had its usual focus on specific companies and the evolution of their strategies in 2020. In addition to the afore-linked India, Jio, and the Four Internets:
<ul><li>Visa, Plaid, Networks, and Jobs The history of credit cards helps explain why Plaid is valuable to Visa, and how Visa can make it significantly better. See also this Daily Update about the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the Visa-Plaid acquisition.</li><li>Apple, ARM, and Intel explained how Apple ended up replacing Intel chips with their own ARM chips, which is a core part of Apple’s Shifting Differentiation to superior hardware integrated with exclusive software. See also this Daily Update about Intel’s ongoing struggles.</li><li>Nvidias Integration Dreams Nvidias acquisition of ARM only makes sense from a financial perspective, unless you buy Jensen Huangs datacenter dreams.</li><li>2020 Bundles The state of bundles in 2020: Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Plus, Microsofts purchase of ZeniMax. See also this Daily Update with more about Microsoft’s ZeniMax purchase, and this Daily Update that explains how Microsoft’s Xbox strategy is dramatically different from Sony’s PS5 strategy.</li><li>Stripe: Platform of Platforms Stripes announcement of Treasury banking-as-a-service manifests the breadth of the companys ambition.</li></ul>
Stratechery Interviews
Thanks to the launch of the Stratechery Daily Update Podcast I devoted more Daily Updates this year to interviews, including:
The Year in Daily Updates
Fifteen of my favorite Daily Updates:
<ul><li>Clayton Christensen Passes Away, Professor Christensen and I, Kobe Bryant and Measuring Your Life There is no greater influence on Stratechery than Professor Clayton Christensen, but it is another death Kobe Bryants that reminds me of what truly matters.</li><li>Epic Systems and Electronic Health Records, Aggregators and Data Portability, Epics Privacy Objections Epic Systems, an electronic health records company, is protesting a mandate that they make consumer health care available via API. Their arguments highlight the tension between interoperability and privacy.</li><li>Spotify Earnings, Podcasts and Lifetime Value, The Ringer Acquisition Spotifys mixed earnings, why podcasts are uniquely valuable to the company, and where The Ringer fits in. See also this Daily Update about Spotify’s acquisition of Megaphone and what it says about their strategy.</li><li>Zoom was covered in the Daily Update multiple times, both because of its explosive growth, and also its ties to China. See here, here, and here</li><li>Apple and Amazon Make a Deal, Three Angles, Apple vs. Amazon Apple and Amazon make a deal; I suspect it has been in the works for a long time, including Apple Music being on Alexa. See also Apple, Amazon, and Common Enemies.</li><li>Facebook Earnings, Auction Dynamics, Full Steam Ahead Facebook earnings demonstrated the power of its auction-based direct-response model; what makes it different from Google is Zuckerbergs drive.</li><li>Media, Regulators, and Big Tech; Indulgences and Injunctions; Better Approaches Blaming Facebook and Google for the media industrys trouble inevitably leads to bad regulations with unintended consequences and the end of accountability for big tech.</li><li>Trumps Executive Order, Section 230 In Court, Public Forums President Trump is poised to sign an executive order that applies to social networks; its reasoning about Section 230 and public forums is not in line with judicial precedent.</li><li>Zuckerbergs Choice, Zuckerbergs Power, Zuckerbergs Conviction Why Mark Zuckerberg has made the right choice about Trumps posts, why his power is a problem, and why his conviction is impressive.</li><li>Australias News Media Bargaining Code, Breaking Down the Code, Australias Fake News Australias new media code forcing Google and Facebook to pay incumbent media companies is wrapped in dishonesty about the reality of the Internet.</li><li>Coinbases Clarification, Spotify and Joe Rogan, A Framework for Politicization Coinbase and Spotify are both grappling with political questions, which is something all companies should prepare for.</li><li>Amazon One, How Amazon One Works, Good or Bad Idea? Amazon announces Amazon One: how does it work, and is the underlying technology a good idea?</li><li>IBM Splits, IBM Skepticism, IBM and Antitrust IBM is splitting itself up, and while it makes sense, it is an admission of failure. Its also a lesson for regulators.</li><li>Tech in Congress, Again; Twitter vs. the New York Post; Who Are the Refs? Congressional tech hearings are becoming more compelling with time, as tech companies run the risk of making not just economic enemies but political ones.</li><li>WarnerMedia to Stream Movies First Day, AT&amp;T Versus HBO, Self-Disruption WarnerMedias move to stream all of its movies on HBO Max appears to be value disruptive, but if the company is actually meaningfully responding to disruption, that was inevitable.</li></ul>

2020-12-15,How Plaid Expanded its Network,"Earlier this year banking technology company PlaidlaunchedPlaid Exchange, a new tool to facilitate open banking.
The new open finance platform offers banks a way to provide open banking connectivity to their clients while keeping their end customers’ data safe and giving them control of their data.
Plaid Exchange helps banks establish token-based API connectivity with the 2,600 third party apps in Plaids network. This single connection simplifies integration for banks, helping their clients connect with more third party providers securely. Plaid Exchange can help banks bring an API solution to market in 12 weeks. 
A couple of weeks back, Plaid formed a key partnership to help it reach more banks to access the Plaid network. The company is working with Jack Henry &amp; Associates to enable Plaid Exchange for banks on the Banno Digital Platform.
The deal helps Plaid reach more than 350 institutions currently using Jack Henrys Banno Digital Platform. These financial institutions can benefit by offering their accountholders access to Plaid-powered fintech apps. Plaid has designed the integration process to be simple and Banno clients will be able to access the technology for free.
The deal with Jack Henry comes as an extension of the Plaid Exchange Partner Program, which is aimed to get banking platform providers, API management platforms, and software development companies on board to offer Plaid Exchange to their bank clients.
The network effects of the Plaid Exchange Partner Program will be a boon to the San Francisco-based company. That’s because the more banks Plaid partners with, the more attractive Plaid is to fintechs.
Plaid works with thousands of third-party fintech apps such as Transferwise, Betterment, and Venmo to connect with their users financial institutions. The company made headlines at the beginning of 2020 after it announced it had been acquired by Visa for $5.3 billion and made the news again after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit to block the acquisition last month.

2021-01-13,Visa Calls Off $5.3B Merger Deal With Plaid Over DOJ Lawsuit,"Markets ended 2020 on a high note, and have started 2021 on a bullish trajectory. All three major indexes have recently surged to all-time highs as investors seemingly looked beyond the pandemic and hoped for signs of a rapid recovery. Veteran strategist Edward Yardeni sees the economic recovery bringing its own slowdown with it. As the COVID vaccination program allows for further economic opening, with more people getting back to work, Yardeni predicts a wave of pent-up demand, increasing wages, and rising prices in short, a recipe for inflation. In the second half of the year we may be on the lookout for some consumer price inflation which would not be good for overvalued assets, Yardeni noted.The warning sign to look for is higher yields in the Treasury bond market. If the Fed eases up on the low-rate policy, Yardeni sees Treasuries reflecting the change first.A situation like this is tailor-made for defensive stock plays and that will naturally bring investors to look at high-yield dividend stocks. Opening up the TipRanks database, weve found three stocks featuring a hat trick of positive signs: A Strong Buy rating, dividend yields starting at 9% or better and a recent analyst review pointing toward double-digit upside.CTO Realty Growth (CTO)We'll start with CTO Realty Growth, a Florida-based real estate company that, last year, made an exciting decision for dividend investors: the company announced that it would change its tax status to that of a real estate investment trust (REIT) for the tax year ending December 31, 2020.

2021-01-15,This Week In Credit Card News: No-Interest Credit Cards? Are Bank Fees Discriminatory?,"Some Banks Want to Consign Credit Card Interest to History
Interest charges have been one of the defining features of credit cards for decades and so when an employee at a big Australian bank suggested getting rid of them, he was taking a risk. But some banks are rethinking what has been one of their most lucrative businesses. National Australia Bank, known locally as NAB, launched a no-interest credit card in September. Users get a fixed line of credit and the bank levies a monthly fee, which is refunded if the customer maintains a zero balance and doesnt use the card. But if they prove to be successful, Australian banks no-interest cards could drive change in other markets. [The Wall Street Journal]
Issuers in Australia have introduced credit cards with no interest.

Black and Hispanic Americans Pay Twice as Much in Bank Fees as Whites
People of color are paying more than twice the amount in banking fees than White Americans, a Bankrate survey found. Black adults report shelling out an average of $12 a month for checking accounts at banks or credit unions and Hispanics are paying $14 a month, on average. White checking account holders said they are paying an average $5 per month. Whites were also more likely to have no-fee accounts, with 79% responding they paid no fees compared to 56% of Blacks and 50% of Hispanics. [CNBC]
'Buy Now, Pay Later' Wave Could Boost PayPal Stock, Disrupt Credit Firms
If Buy Now, Pay Later really takes off, it is primarily bad for the credit card issuers, particularly credit card issuers that appeal to lower-FICO consumers, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. She said Visa and Mastercard make more money if consumers buy online products with four installment payments rather than making one payment. The addition of PayPal to the mix could create even more disruption. PayPal launched its buy now, pay later service in late 2020. App users pay 25% of an online item's cost upfront, and the rest in three installment payments, one every two weeks. PayPal charges no interest. [Investors Business Daily]
Major Credit Card Issuers Are Offering Financial Hardship Help
The pandemics lasting effects will undoubtedly leave some credit card holders struggling financially and looking for help from their card issuers. Banks, credit unions and other issuers continue to offer credit card hardship programs and other assistance, but such programs typically grant relief on a case-by-case basis and only when requested, which means youll have to contact your issuer for help. Most major credit card issuers have dedicated web pages that explain their Covid-19 financial-hardship options. [The Street]

Mastercard Launches Pilot Program Using Smartphones as POS Devices
Mastercard is testing a cloud-based setup that will enable contactless payments acceptance via a mobile phone. This Cloud Tap on Phone will mean that any business, regardless of size, can deliver new and best-in-class contactless consumer experiences using a device they already own: a smartphone. The company said the setup democratizes point-of-sale technology by turning an Android smartphone or tablet into an acceptance device, allowing businesses to accept contactless payments and minimizing the need to invest in hardware terminals or extra features. The new pilot program will test the cloud-based point of sale technology. [PYMNTS]

Visa Abandons Planned Acquisition of Plaid After DOJ Challenge
Visa abandoned its $5.3 billion planned acquisition of financial-technology firm Plaid amid a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit that challenged the deal. The department sued to block the deal in November, alleging the acquisition would allow Visa to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in the online debit card market. Plaid, the government argued, was a nascent but important competitive threat to Visa, and eliminating that threat would lead to higher prices, less innovation and higher entry barriers for online debit services.

Pandemic Dramatically Sped Up Shift to Online Shopping
Online shopping became essential in 2020, increasing by about 20% from the previous year, said Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach. While some consumers are looking forward to visiting local businesses again when it's safe, that growth rate won't go back down to slower pre-pandemic figures. Consumers will be more likely to make repetitive purchases of everyday items online. In-store purchases may be more limited to purchases that consumers want advice from knowledgeable retailers before making. [CNet]

2021-01-12,Visa abandons $5.3 billion acquisition after DOJ objections,"Markets ended 2020 on a high note, and have started 2021 on a bullish trajectory. All three major indexes have recently surged to all-time highs as investors seemingly looked beyond the pandemic and hoped for signs of a rapid recovery. Veteran strategist Edward Yardeni sees the economic recovery bringing its own slowdown with it. As the COVID vaccination program allows for further economic opening, with more people getting back to work, Yardeni predicts a wave of pent-up demand, increasing wages, and rising prices in short, a recipe for inflation. In the second half of the year we may be on the lookout for some consumer price inflation which would not be good for overvalued assets, Yardeni noted.The warning sign to look for is higher yields in the Treasury bond market. If the Fed eases up on the low-rate policy, Yardeni sees Treasuries reflecting the change first.A situation like this is tailor-made for defensive stock plays and that will naturally bring investors to look at high-yield dividend stocks. Opening up the TipRanks database, weve found three stocks featuring a hat trick of positive signs: A Strong Buy rating, dividend yields starting at 9% or better and a recent analyst review pointing toward double-digit upside.CTO Realty Growth (CTO)We'll start with CTO Realty Growth, a Florida-based real estate company that, last year, made an exciting decision for dividend investors: the company announced that it would change its tax status to that of a real estate investment trust (REIT) for the tax year ending December 31, 2020. REITs have long been known for their high dividend yields, a product of tax code requirements that these companies return a high percentage of their profits directly to shareholders. Dividends are usual route of that return.For background, CTO holds a varied portfolio of real estate investments. The holdings include 27 income properties in 11 states, totaling more than 2.4 million square feet, along with 18 leasable billboards in Florida. The income properties are mainly shopping centers and retail outlets. During the third quarter, the most recent reported, CTO sold off some 3,300 acres of undeveloped land for $46 million, acquired two income properties for $47.9 million, and collected ~93% of contractual base rents due. The company also authorized a one-time special distribution, in connection with its shift to REIT status; its purpose was to put the company in compliance with income return regulation during tax year 2020. The one-time distribution was made in cash and stock, and totaled $11.83 per share.The regular dividend paid in Q3 was 40 cents per common share. That was increased in Q4 to $1, a jump of 150%; again, this was done to put the company in compliance with REIT-status requirements. At the current dividend rate, the yield is 9.5%, far higher than the average among financial sector peer companies.Analyst Craig Kucera, of B. Riley, believes that CTO has plenty of options going forward to expand its portfolio through acquisition: CTO hit the high end of anticipated disposition guidance at $33M in 4Q20, bringing YTD dispositions to nearly $85M, with the largest disposition affiliated with the exercise of a tenant's option to purchase a building from CTO in Aspen, CO. Post these dispositions, we estimate &gt;$30M in cash and restricted cash for additional acquisitions, and we expect CTO to be active again in 1H21.To this end, Kucera rates CTO a Buy along with a $67 price target. At current levels, his target implies a 60% one-year upside potential. (To watch Kuceras track record, click here)Overall, CTO has 3 reviews on record from Wall Streets analysts, and they all agree that this stock is a Buy, making the analyst consensus of Strong Buy unanimous. The shares are priced at $41.85, and their average price target of $59.33 suggests room for ~42% growth in the year ahead. (See CTO stock analysis on TipRanks)Holly Energy Partners (HEP)The energy sector, with its high cash flows, is also known for its high-paying dividend stocks. Holly Energy Partners is a midstream transportation player in sector, providing pipeline, terminal, and storage services for producers of crude oil and petroleum distillate products. Holly bases most of its operations in the Colorado-Utah and New Mexico-Texas-Oklahoma regions. In 2019, the last full year for which numbers are available, the company saw $533 million in total revenues.The companys revenues in 2020 slipped in the first and second quarters, but rebounded in Q3, coming in at $127.7 million. Holly reported at distributable cash flow from which dividends are paid of $76.9 million, up more than $8 million year-over-year. This supported a 35-cent dividend payment per regular share, or $1.40 annualized. At that rate, the dividend yields a strong 10%.Noting the dividend, Well Fargo analyst Michael Blum wrote, Our model suggests the distribution is sustainable at this level as [lost revenue] is offset by inflation escalators in HEP's pipeline contracts and contributions from the Cushing Connect JV project. About 80% of HEP's distribution is tax-deferred.Blum gives HEP a $20 price target and an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating. His target implies a 38% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Blums track record, click here)""Our rating primarily reflects the partnership's steady, fee-based cash flows, robust yield and conservative balance sheet, Blum added.For the most part, Wall Street agrees with Blums assessment on HEP, as shown by the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. That rating is supported by 6 reviews, split 5 to 1 Buys versus Hold. The average price target, at $18.67, suggests that the stock has room to grow ~29% this year. (See HEP stock analysis on TipRanks)DHT Holdings (DHT)Midstreaming is only one part of the global oil industrys transport network. Tankers are another, moving crude oil, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas around the world, in bulk. Bermuda-based DHT operates a fleet of 27 crude oil tankers, all rated VLCC (very large crude carrier). These vessels are 100% owned by the company, and range in tonnage from 298K to 320K. VLCCs are the workhorses of the global oil tanker network.After four quarters of sequential revenue gains, even through the corona half of 1H20, DHT posted a sequential drop in revenues from 2Q20 to 3Q20. The top line that quarter fell from $245 million to $142 million. Its important to note, however, that the 3Q revenue result was still up 36.5% year-over-year. EPS, at 32 cents, was a dramatic yoy turnaround from the 6-cent loss posted in 3Q19.DHT has a history of adjusting its dividend, when needed, to keep it in line with earnings. The company did that in Q3, and the 20-cent per regular share payment was the first dividend cut in 5 quarters. The general policy is a positive for dividend investors, however, as the company has not missed a dividend payment in 43 consecutive quarters an admirable record. At 80 cents per share annualized, the dividend yields an impressive 14%.Kepler analyst Petter Haugen covers DHT, and he sees potential for increased returns in the companys contract schedule. Haugen noted, With 8 out of 16 vessels ending their TC contracts by end Q1 2021, we believe DHT is well positioned for when we expect freight rates to appreciate in H2 2021E.Getting into more details, Haugen adds, [The] main underlying drivers are still intact: fleet growth will be low (1% on average over 2020- 23E) and the US will still end up being a net seaborne exporter of crude oil, making further export growth from the US drive tanker demand. We expect spot rates to improve again during 2021E, shortly after oil demand has normalised. We expect average VLCC rates of USD41,000/day in 2022E and USD55,000/day in 2023E.In line with his comments, Haugen rates DHT a Buy. His $7.40 target price suggests that this stock can grow 34% in the months ahead. (To watch Haugens track record, click here)The rest of the Street is getting onboard. 3 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. In addition, the $6.13 average price target puts the potential upside at ~11%.

2021-01-13,"Visa, Plaid Pull Out Of $5.3B Merger Deal After US Regulator Steps In","Visa Inc. and Plaid announced the termination of their $5.3 billion merger agreement after the US Department of Justice (DoJ) filed a lawsuit to block the deal in a move to preserve competition.
Visa (V) said that following the termination, the DoJ decided to dismiss the litigation related to the proposed merger, which was first announced on January 13 last year. The DoJ filed a civil antitrust lawsuit on Nov. 5, 2020, claiming that Visa is a monopolist in online debit, charging consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments.
Plaid is a fintech firm, which is developing a payments platform and therefore, the deal would have eliminated this competitive threat to Visas online debit business and strengthened its monopoly, according to the DoJ.
We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaids capabilities are complementary to Visas, not competitive, said Visa CEO Al Kelly. We believe the combination of Visa with Plaid would have delivered significant benefits, including greater innovation for developers, financial institutions and consumers. However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.
The laswsuit was scheduled for trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on June 28, 2021.
Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visas online debit services. With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services, said Makan Delrahim of the DoJs antitrust division.
Looking ahead, Visas Kelly said that the company will be focused on pushing its three growth pillars: consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.
Over the past year, our Visa Direct solution moved money around the world using multiple card, ACH and RTP networks, growing nearly 70 percent. In addition, our value-added services revenue has grown in the mid-to-high-teens, Kelly added.
Commenting on the termination of the merger deal, Oppenheimer analyst Dominick Gabriele reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $245 price target (17% upside potential) as he doesnt expect EPS headwinds due to the termination.
V is likely to recreate over time Plaid's capabilities through Plaid/non-Plaid partnerships/organically and/or through acquisition; it's just a longer path with less immediate cross sell, Gabriele wrote in a note to investors.
The announcement doesn't mean V's LT Fintech partnership strategy is broken, only likely delayed, the analyst added. (See V stock analysis on TipRanks)
The rest of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 18 Buys and 3 Holds. With shares up almost 8% over the past year, the average analyst price target of $229.37 implies upside potential of another 9.8% over the coming year.

2020-12-14,BaT Auction: 1975 Volkswagen Type 2 Westfalia,"This 1975 Volkswagen Type 2 Westfalia is a P22 pop-top Campmobile finished in orange with white bumpers over an orange plaid interior. Power comes a fuel-injected 1.8L flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a sink, a refrigerator, tables, a convertible bed, and a pop-up tent with a mesh window, along with a factory AM/FM radio and auxiliary lighting. The van reportedly remained in the same family for most of its life, and was acquired by the selling dealer in 2020 shortly after receiving an oil change. This Westy Bus is now offered with accessories and a New Hampshire registration certificate.
The bus is finished in Brilliant Orange with a rear-hinged Westfalia pop-top featuring ‘Road Runner’ lettering up front, said to be a reference to the nickname of the first owner. Exterior equipment includes auxiliary lighting, a front-mounted spare tire with a cover, louvered side windows, a side step, and painted bumpers. The seller notes the front was refinished to correct stone chips, and that nicks and dings are present around the body, and a rust spot can be seen at the windshield seal.
Silver-painted steel 14″ wheels wear polished VW hubcaps and Continental Contact tires.
The interior is trimmed in orange including the door panels and side window curtains, with plaid cloth seating surfaces front and rear. Front cabin amenities include vent windows and a factory AM/FM radio, and the seller states the front seat cushion padding has been refurbished.
The two-spoke steering wheel frames a 90-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and a fuel gauge along with warning lights. The five-digit odometer shows just over 23k miles, with true mileage unknown.
The rear cabin features wood-grain cabinetry, a sink, a fold-away table, and a convertible bed. A refrigerator is fitted, and the seller notes its door handle is damaged. Vinyl seat covers are included in the sale, along with a plaid pillow said to be added by a previous owner.
The air-cooled 1.8L flat-four is equipped with Bosch fuel injection. An oil change and inspection is said to have been completed prior to the seller’s acquisition.
Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. Additional underside photos are presented in the gallery below.

2020-12-10,"Cleo, the AI-powered 'financial assistant', raises $44M Series B led by EQT Ventures","Cleo, the London founded ""financial assistant"" that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44 million in Series B funding.
Leading the round, which I understand actually closed earlier this year, is EQT Ventures. Also participating are existing investors Balderton Capital, LocalGlobe and SBI.
They join much earlier investors such as Entrepreneur First, Taavet Hinrikus, Matt Robinson, Errol Damelin, Niklas Zennstrom, Alex Chesterman, and Ian Hogarth -- all well-known names in London's tech investment community.
Targeting ""Gen Z"" and with a rather lofty sounding mission to ""fight for the world's financial health,"" Cleo's AI/machine learning-powered app connects to your bank accounts and gives you proactive advice and information on your finances, including timely nudges, to help you stay on top of your spending. Over time, the idea is that Cleo can help change your financial behaviour for the better.
The broader premise is that Cleo can replace your bank's own app, and by speaking to you in a more human and user-friendly way, improve your financial health. In addition, and crucially -- as Cleo founder Barney Hussey-Yeo is fond of arguing -- the company can do all of this without having the same cost base or misaligned incentives of an actual bank.
The assumption made in 2017, when Cleo really got off the ground, was that through a combination of data science and machine learning, delivered in a fun and openly gamified way, the companys financial assistant chatbot could attract and retain gen z and millennial users. Then, after engaging with the app, users would have experienced enough value to upgrade to a paid subscription or various financial services offered through Cleo now or in the future. With 4 million registered users -- 96 percent of whom are in the U.S. -- the first part appears to be panning out.
Hussey-Yeo tells me the new funding round gives him a mandate to take some big product bets in order to move forward the financial health of Cleos users. [Those product bets] wont all work out, but if one or two of them connects, well fundamentally change the game in some of the most broken areas in financial services.
In addition, the company will expand its operations in the U.S., including building out executive and product teams in San Francisco.
When we launched in the U.S it became quickly apparent that it would be our dominant market, says the Cleo founder. We were signing up about 1,000 users per day in the U.K. at the time. After [just] a week, we were at 10,000 per day in the U.S. and kept growing.
Hussey-Yeo attributes a lot of the success state-side to better banking APIs in the U.S. with Plaid, which he says dramatically drove up conversion rates and lowered customer acquisition costs. This combined with a much larger market focused us 100% on winning in the U.S. first. This race is far from played out.
Hussey-Yeo says Cleo will always offer a free version ""because everybody needs the ability to make smarter decisions about their financial lives''. In contrast, the premium product costs $5.99 per month and is intended for people who ""need a little extra help,"" providing features such as gamified savings, and ""levelled up"" credit scores with coaching. Premium users can also trigger a $100 salary advance designed to stop them dipping into a costly bank overdraft.
Meanwhile, Cleo says it has grown revenue by 400 percent in the last twelve months, and Hussey-Yeo tells me the company is now doing $10 million-plus ARR. In a further nod towards stronger unit economics, the cost to acquire a user is now less than $2 with the vast majority of users acquired organically.
""So were definitely not in growth at all costs mode,"" he says. ""Weve worked hard over the last 12 months to bring our payback period comfortably under 12 months which is an incredibly rare feat at scale for fintech.
One interesting aspect of Cleos mission and the strong personality its chatbot exhibits, is that the problem space the company is tackling is potentially based on behavioural science as much as it is data science. Hussey-Yeo doesnt disagree.
This is where the idea of a conversational interface came from, he says. I realised you could break the complexity down into a language anyone could engage with, and I mean actually look forward to engaging with it, to ultimately change their behaviour.
Today we have an outstanding machine learning department but just as importantly is the behavioural researchers and writers at Cleo. We know this is the combination that makes Cleo special and, I hope, will eventually lead to us being the financial advisor for a billion people.","Cleo, the London founded ""financial assistant"" that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44..."

Hi friends , 
Happy Monday! Most weeks, as Im researching and writing and preparing to hit send, I feel like a total imposter. 
Sometimes, like when Im writing about the future of the office or Slack, topics that Ive spent years thinking about, working in, and using, Im comfortable that I know what Im talking about and am qualified to opine. But mostly, Im dropping into new territory and writing thousands of words about industries and companies in which other people have spent most of their working lives. When the topic is technical, I feel it even more.
This weeks topic - APIs - is among the most imposter syndrome-inducing yet. On the one hand, it feels like Im stating the obvious: APIs are an increasingly important piece of how software is built. On the other, I feel like I have nowhere near the technical depth or hands-on experience to write about the topic with the nuance it deserves. 
But in these cases, I view my role as being the shameless kid in class whos not afraid to raise his hand and ask the question that everyone else is thinking. If theres something happening that I know is important, but dont know nearly enough about, and I do this for a living, chances are there are many of you who want to understand it a little bit better, too. This, then, is the beginning of an exploration, and I look forward to your thoughts and feedback. 
Now lets get to it. 
Some ancient Asian cosmological views are close to the idea of an infinite regression of causes, as exemplified in the following apocryphal story: A Western traveler encountering an Oriental philosopher asks him to describe the nature of the world: It is a great ball resting on the flat back of the world turtle. Ah yes, but what does the world turtle stand on? On the back of a still larger turtle. Yes, but what does he stand on? A very perceptive question. But its no use, mister; its turtles all the way down.

Stripetechery
On Thursday, the kind of thing that gets people like me very excited happened: Ben Thompson wrote about Stripe, which announced its new Stripe Treasury product, and interviewed its co-founder and President, John Collison. 
Stripe Treasury is a banking-as-a-service API that lets you embed financial services in your marketplace or platform. Simply, by writing a few lines of code, platforms can let their customers set up bank accounts at partner banks like Goldman Sachs and Evolve Bank &amp; Trust. 
In the press release, Stripe highlighted its partnership with Shopify, which is using Treasury to build Shopify Balance. Now, when a merchant creates a Shopify account, they can set up a bank account at the same time, through the same platform. 
Thats incredibly cool in its own right, but it triggered bells in my head for another reason. When I was researching and writing Stripe: The Internets Most Undervalued Company, I asked people for the biggest knocks on Stripe. One answer I heard from multiple people was that they had too much customer concentration with Shopify -- by one estimate, even before the pandemic, Stripe was generating $350 million in revenue from Shopify alone -- and that Shopify would inevitably get sick of paying Stripe and build their own payments solutions. 
The Shopify Balance announcement means that the opposite is true. Instead of pulling its business, Shopify is integrating more deeply with Stripe. Many of its clients will keep their money in accounts managed by banks with which Stripe, not Shopify or the merchant, owns the relationship. Think of the switching costs if Shopify were to try to pull out of the relationship now. Theyre practically married.
Shopify is a really smart company. It wouldnt tie its own hands for no good reason. Instead, it made a deliberate, strategic choice to focus on the things that it does best, and to plug in Stripe for all of the things that it does best. Thats what third-party APIs enable their customers to do. 
API is one of those acronyms you hear a lot. You might know that it means Application Programming Interface, and you might even know that APIs are the way software talks to other software, but if youre like me, youve never really gone deep on them.
The Stripe x Shopify announcement woke me up, though, and led me down a rabbit hole to places both familiar and new, to the question of what good strategy looks like on the internet and why most companies should just be API Frankensteins with one main point of differentiation. Like the turtles, modern software is APIs all the way down.
So today, Im going to take you down there with me. Well explore:

What Are APIs? 
Theres an old Picasso fable that goes something like this: 
A woman approaches Picasso in a restaurant, asks him to sketch something on a napkin for her, and tells him that shed be happy to pay whatever its worth. He obliges, scribbles something quickly, and asks for $10,000. $10,000!? the woman replies in shock, But you just did that in 30 seconds! No, Picasso tells the woman, It has taken me 40 years to do that.
Thats one way to think about an API. APIs let companies leverage years of other companies work in seconds. 
For a more technical but approachable explanation, Justin Gages Whats an API? and APIs For the REST of Us are the two best resources Ive found. According to Justin:
Applications are just a bunch of functions that get things done: APIs wrap those functions in easy to use interfaces so you can work with them without being an expert.
An engineer writes a bunch of code to manage complex things, and builds an API on top of the code to abstract away most of the complexity so that using all of that code is as simple as writing a few lines of code.
On Invest Like the Best, Benchmarks Eric Vishria describes it simply: people interact with software through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), software interacts with software through APIs. 
APIs handle an ever-increasing amount of things that get done in the world. Something that might have been a pen and paper process involving hundreds of people 50 years ago, and a dozen people clicking a computer screen a decade ago, is probably software talking to other software via APIs today. 
There are three types of APIs: 
<ol><li>Internal APIs: Used to do complex things more simply within a company. 
</li><li>Public APIs: Typically used to open up datasets so the public can build on top of them. 
</li><li>Vendor APIs: Give customers the full superpowers of an entire company in a few lines of code.
</li></ol>Today, were focusing on Vendor APIs, also known as third-party APIs. The companies who sell third-party APIs are called API-first companies (still with me?). 
Whereas an internal or public API abstracts away the complexity of some code through one clean endpoint, like this: 
An API-first company essentially abstracts away the complexity of a whole best-in-class company, giving clients the full output of a highly-focused org by typing a few things, like this: 
Hiring has traditionally been one of the most important things a company does. Picking the right API vendor is like the hiring decision on steroids. When a company chooses to plug in a third-party API, its essentially deciding to hire that entire company to handle a whole function within its business. Imagine copying in some code and getting the Collison brothers to run your Finance team. Just like in traditional hiring, the impact of that decision compounds over time, for better or for worse, but at full company scale.
So lets get to know the job candidates. 
The API-First Ecosystem 
API-first companies are a subset of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies, with a few key distinguishing features: 
<ul><li>Purchasing Decision. Traditional SaaS is a department-head, IT, or exec purchasing decision, while API-first is typically a product and engineering purchasing decision. 
</li><li>Users. Many people in a company interact with a typical SaaS product (like Slack, Salesforce, Airtable, Asana), whereas only the engineers typically work with API-first companies.
</li><li>Business Model. The most common SaaS business model is to charge per seat, while most API-first companies charge customers by usage of the product, either based on Pay Per Call (each time the API is pinged, say if youre sending an SMS via Twilio) or as a percentage of transaction size (Stripe charges 2.9% plus $0.30 for each transaction). 
</li><li>Use Case. Traditional SaaS products help employees get things done, APIs automatically do those things themselves. 
</li></ul>API-first companies can be confusing to explain, because many of them offer both API products and traditional SaaS products. Their customers run the gamut, from large platforms like Shopify and Uber all the way down to individuals who want to accept payments online, and everything in between. Puja and I just had pictures taken with Dev, and the photographer sent us her invoice via Stripe. She was using one of Stripes traditional SaaS products with a GUI, not writing code. 
For this essay, though, well be talking about API-first companies whose customers build functionality into their products or internal processes via APIs. 
Those companies are increasingly able to build nearly everything non-core through APIs. In The Third-Party API Economy, Canvas Ventures Grace Isford maps dozens of players in the space across nineteen separate verticals. 
Theres an app for that is now theres an API for that. For almost anything that a business needs to do, theres an API-first company with a product or suite of products they can plug in. Whats incredible to me about this graphic is that each logo represents something that a company would have had to build on its own previously, that it can now do by writing a few lines of code, and do better than they would have ever been able to in-house. 
There are two main reasons for that: focus and scale. 
Focus. API-first companies focus on solving a very specific problem. Stripe started with payments, and put all of their efforts into building the best payments solution. Twilio started with messaging and calling. Plaid does bank data, Algolia does search, Shippo does shipping, Checkr does background checks. That focus means that everything the company does is oriented towards solving all of the problems related to that particular area. 
Importantly, it means that everyone who works for those companies went there to solve those problems. Whereas an engineer at Uber who signed up to change transportation would be pissed off if she were assigned to work on background checks, because its not the companys core product, an engineer at Checkr is stoked to work on background checks, because thats what the company is all about! 
Scale. API-first companies serve thousands or millions of customers, so theyre able to justify small improvements that build up to an incredible product over time. Plaid can spend the effort to integrate with even very small financial institutions, for example, since there will likely be thousands of people who use that bank across all of the products that use Plaid. 
API-first companies focus and scale give their software-building customers best-in-class products that constantly improve at costs that scale with their business. From the product side, they can be godsends. Theyre also fascinating strategically in two ways: the competitive advantages of the API-first companies themselves and the impact they have on their customers competitive advantages. Lets start with their customers. 
Good Internet Strategy, Bad Internet Strategy
While I write more often about 7 Powers and The Outsiders, Richard Rumelts Good Strategy, Bad Strategy is probably my favorite practical strategy handbook ever written. 
Good strategy almost always looks simple and obvious and does not take a thick deck of Powerpoint slides to explain. It does not pop out of some strategic management tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill-in-the-blanks scheme. Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
This is the beauty of API-first companies. They allow customers to focus on the one or two things that differentiate their businesses, while plugging in best-in-class solutions everywhere else. Just as AWS and the cloud let entrepreneurs launch more cheaply, API-first businesses allow them to scale and professionalize with low upfront costs and managerial effort. As one person in the space told me, Its actually becoming crazy to build your business in any way other than using all APIs except your point of differentiation.
Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of leading API-first company, Twilio, might disagree with the premise of talking strategy at all. On the Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast, he said: 
I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, youre probably off-course, actually. Theres only one business strategy: serve your customers. 
I dont think that Rumelt and Lawson would disagree, actually. Both point at the same idea, that what people call strategy is often a bunch of fancy words and falsely precise goals that obfuscate the core purpose of the business: serving customers in a differentiated way. Judiciously using APIs where possible gives companies strategic clarity and the ability to solve their customers problems in a way that only they can. 
Identifying the one or two critical issues (Diagnosis) is just one piece of the problem. Good Strategy also involves defining a guiding policy and coherent actions.
A guiding policy outlines an overall approach for overcoming the obstacles highlighted by the diagnosis and tackles the obstacles identified in the diagnosis by creating or drawing upon sources of advantage. It channels a companys energy towards the areas where it has unique advantages.
Coherent actions are the set of interconnected things that a company does to carry out the guiding policy, each reinforcing the other to build a chain-link system that is nearly impossible to replicate.  Walmart isnt the leading retailer because it has lower prices, or because it puts its stores in a certain type of town, or because its built up the right distribution network, or because of any single thing that it does. Its the leading retailer because all of those pieces work together in such a way that no one could copy Walmart without copying the whole system.
If Lawson will indulge me, there are actually some pretty wild strategic implications to coherent actions in an API-first ecosystem, in which the traditional conveyor belt-style value chain model no longer makes sense. 
Traditionally, the coherent actions taken by a company would look something like Michael Porters Value Chain, which we discussed at length in Shopify and the Hard Thing About Easy Things. In 1985, Porter wrote:
Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering, and supporting its product.""
Those discrete activities comprise a companys value chain (although Rumelt might bristle at the word discrete and focus more on the links between activities). The Direct-to-Consumer Value Chain, for example, looks something like this (sans Support Activities):
Its clean and linear, like a pipeline. R&amp;D leads to manufacturing, and so on. 
But in a world in which APIs infiltrate ever more functions of a business, the linear value chain no longer perfectly describes a companys activities. Chris Sperandio, now at Stripe, wrote a piece while at Segment arguing that there needs to be a new, more dynamic model of a firm: the Request/Response model. 
In the essay on Shopify, I wrote: 
Heres the hard thing about easy things: if everyone can do something, theres no advantage to doing it, but you still have to do it anyway just to keep up. 
That applies to the DTC Value Chain, and to some extent, it applies to software and platform businesses building with many of the same APIs. If your competitor is using Twilio to send SMS to clients, you should, too, or else theyre free to build differentiated products while you spin your wheels reinventing the wheel. In the Request/Response Model, though, there is also a competitive advantage to be gained from how you leverage APIs to build your company and product. 
Using a bunch of APIs that are really flexible, and figuring out good ways to connect them, leads to a combinatorial explosion of potential workflows. API-first companies turn software into like customizable building blocks, and companies like Zapier and Tray.io function as APIs for all APIs, making connections between nearly any app with an API fast and easy.
Not only can you put the building blocks together in unique ways (the Infrastructure column in the Request/Response model), but you can also build new experiences on top of them (the Operations and Experience columns in the Request/Response model).
If the number of potential connections between APIs increases exponentially as more are added, companies have a near-infinite ability to create unique chain-link systems of coherent actions out of the existing primitives. Instead of a linear value chain in which using commoditized components in each step limits the number of places left to differentiate and create value, the Request/Response Model lets companies differentiate on two main fronts: 
<ol><li>Direct. The core focus area, for which they build their own solutions. 
</li><li>Meta. The way that they organize all of the components in their ecosystem. 
</li></ol>That creates a dynamic system in place of a static chain, one that constantly improves and evolves as the companies behind each one of the components work on building the best possible input for their customers. 
So Why Does Shopify Rely So Heavily on Stripe?
Which brings us back to why Shopify works so closely with Stripe, even though they paid an estimated $350 million for the privilege even before their pandemic-fueled growth, and why they continue to strengthen the partnership. Its just good strategy. Shopify focuses on its key differentiators and building a coherent whole that is differentiated even while many of the components are modularized.
Stripe is the prototypical API-first company. It does a whole lot of complicated things behind the scenes, and offers it to customers in a few lines of code that abstract away all of the complexity. When a company chooses to use Stripe Payments, it copies in those few lines of code and sits back while Stripe pushes updates to its core API 16 times per day. It lowers fraud, improves acceptance rates, accepts payments from more countries, pushes faster payouts, and does countless other little things that improve the payments piece of their customers businesses. That translates into more money over time, with no extra effort.
And its not just Payments. Its Treasury, Subscriptions, Billing, and Corporate Cards. The products it offers customers seemingly grow by the day as it leverages its work in one area to expand into adjacent areas with the goal of Increasing the GDP of the Internet. Two days before launching Stripe Treasury, for example, Patrick Collison announced Stripe Capital for Platforms, which lets platforms like Shopify lend money to their customers, again, by writing a few lines of code. 
By working with Stripe, Shopify gave its customers the power to seamlessly collect payments, then to easily manage subscriptions, then to borrow money, and now to launch bank accounts in a few clicks. Shopify is able to build products in months that would otherwise take years, and even then, wouldnt match what Stripe is able to do given its unique focus and all of the hard, non-technical, regulator-and-bank-related work it does behind the scenes.
In that sense, the Stripe x Shopify partnership is like an API in itself. Shopify plugs in Stripe, and Stripe continues to add new money-related products that Shopify can use itself and give to its customers. 
The better each Stripe product gets, and the more great products it offers, the less likely Shopify is to ever leave. And why would it? Instead of hiring armies of engineers and spending management brainpower on a second-class product outside of its core competency, it can pay Stripe to handle all of that. Stripe can build robust money-related solutions for Shopify at a lower cost than Shopify could build for itself, because Stripe is able to amortize the costs of everything that it builds over millions of customers, some large and many small. 
Lest you worry about Shopifys dependence, though, while Thompsons graphic shows Shopify as just one of many potential Stripe customers, Stripe is also just one of many third-party APIs that Shopify uses. When Twilio talks about its Flex product, for example, it uses Shopify as a case study. Flex, Twilios call center API, lets Shopify build customer experience solutions that it only dreamed of before, because Twilio has spent a dozen years and hundreds of millions of dollars creating all of the building blocks that Shopifys team can use to design new solutions in minutes. 
As I was talking to my friend Ben Rollert, whos building a company on top of APIs, he said that the value system in an API-first world actually looks more like the game Factorio than a traditional Porter Value chain. 
Its probably not a coincidence that Factorio is one of Shopify CEO Tobi Lutkes favorite video games, and the one game that he lets every employee expense. Uncoincidentally, Shopify is the low-key leader in building a business using APIs wherever possible in order to focus on its unique point of differentiation: building best-in-class digital eCommerce solutions. 
Just two weeks ago, for example, Shopify launched Handshake, a wholesale marketplace it acquired last year in order to compete with unicorn startup, Faire. Giving Shopify merchants access to more inventory at better terms all in one place is core to what Shopify does, and it takes advantage of the scale benefits that Shopify itself has, bringing demand from millions of retailers to bear on wholesale negotiations. 
Strategy is about knowing when to say no, so that when you say yes, you can go all-in. Because Shopify spends less time on non-core things, its able to increase its product velocity on the things that really matter to its customers. 
The Magic of API-First Business Models
Now how about the API-first businesses themselves? 
Strong API-first businesses sit in this sweet spot: they provide mission critical but non-core functionality to their customers, like accepting payments, providing cloud security, or sending communications to customers. 
That means two things: 
<ol><li>Massive Markets. API-first companies each provide a small slice of the things every business needs to do. Almost every company needs to collect money, remain secure, and communicate with customers. 
</li><li>Moats. Theyre in a position in which companies cant just rip them out -- imagine not accepting payments for even a day! -- but where its probably not worth the resources or defocusing to build a different solution in-house. 
</li></ol>Shopifys increasing dependence on Stripe and Twilio also points to the importance of that position. And its not just Shopify. Facebooks WhatsApp pays Twilio $100mm per year for account verification. 
One of the most common refrains that API-first businesses hear is, Oh Company X will just build that in-house, and yet, they almost never do. Its not for lack of resources. Facebook generated more profit in 2019 ($57 billion) than Twilios entire market cap ($51 billion). Its that once theyre integrated into a customers product, API-first companies have incredibly deep moats. Specifically, they benefit from network effects, economies of scale, and high switching costs. 
Network Effects
The best API-first businesses have data network effects: the more customers that use the product, the better the product gets for each customer, because the API-first business can use data from one customer to improve the product for all of them. For example, every time a company uses Checkr to run a background check on someone, Checkr gets data on that person that it can use to benefit the next company who wants to hire them and it can pick up patterns across millions of people that allow it to perform more accurate checks more quickly and cheaply.
Additionally, API-first companies that negotiate with third-parties on their customers behalf -- Stripe with credit card companies on fees, Shippo with FedEx and UPS on shipping rates, Twilio with carriers on messaging fees -- can bring the heft of their collective bargaining power to the table for their customers in a way that none of them could on their own. 
Economies of Scale 
API-first companies have scale economies advantages not just over new entrants, but more importantly, over their own customers who might consider just building the functionality in-house. Since they focus on one category and amortize their development costs over thousands or millions of customers, theyre able to build for all of the little edge cases that add up to big advantages. Twilio has relationships and contracts with every phone carrier and telco across the world, meaning that a customer can just plug them in and expect to get their messages delivered or their calls completed anywhere their customers may be. It would make practically zero sense for any one company not focused on the space to negotiate all of those deals for themselves, and even if they did, they wouldnt have the same bargaining power Twilio does. 
Switching Costs
Remember, one of the main reasons that companies use API-first products is that doing so gives them peace of mind that that slice of their business is in good hands so that they can focus on their own points of differentiation. Even if a company thinks it can save a little money or get a slightly better experience by switching vendors, doing so requires prioritizing that work over the countless things on the roadmap that are core to what the business does. 
Since most API products are building blocks that customers can use to create their own custom solutions and workflows, moreover, switching costs increase as customers build on top of APIs. 
Additionally, as an API-first company adds more functionality and products, as Stripe has done with both the Payments product and new products like Treasury, customers become more locked in. This is particularly true if an end user stores anything -- from money to data -- with the API-first companys products. If a company needs to ask its customers to do something in order to continue using the service as usual, it will likely be too worried about churn or inaction to switch. 
This indirect relationship with the end user points to another advantage of the API-first business model: customer-led growth. In Slack: The Bulls Are Typing, we talked about the fact that Slack sold into companies and then grew as they grew headcount. API-first companies have a model thats potentially even more powerful. Once they convince a customer to embed their code, the onus is on the customer to grow their own customer base. That means that all of the Facebook and Google dollars fall on the customer, and that as they spend money to grow, the API-first company goes along for the ride. 
There are a few challenges and risks to the API-first business model, though: 
<ol><li>Margins may be lower than traditional SaaS businesses. Many traditional SaaS products benefit from the high upfront costs, low marginal costs nature of software. APIs, on the other hand, often put a nice wrapper on top of existing products that come with their own costs. Stripe still has to pay credit card processing fees, for example, while Twilio has to pay carriers to send messages and make calls. API-first companies are typically lower-margin, higher-volume products. 
</li><li>Other API-first companies are coming after your place in the stack. The most valuable place in the API stack is to be right between your customer and all of their other vendors, abstracting away the complexity created by the other companies abstracting away complexity below them. Segment, for example, which Twilio recently acquired, is a Customer Data Platform that ingests all of the data that a company's other vendors create about its customers. It controls the customer relationship and modularizes the other APIs below it. 
</li></ol>That leads to one of the most important things to realize about API-first companies: theyre a lot more than just software. Anything that just takes complex code and simplifies it is probably at risk of being upstreamed by competitors or new entrants. The magic of companies like Stripe and Twilio is that in addition to elegant software, they do the schlep work in the real world that other people dont want to do. Stripe does software plus compliance, regulatory, risk, and bank partnerships. Twilio does software plus carrier and telco deals across the world, deliverability optimization, and unification of all customer communication touchpoints.
Getting the benefit of all of that grunt work in a few lines of code is why customers sign up for API-first products and stick with them, even as their bills balloon. 
Twilio and Investing in API-First
APIs give their customers superpowers. Thats the phrase you see most often when researching the space and talking to people in it. Its also how I felt when I found Twilio. 
My first exposure to the wonderful world of third-party APIs came six years ago, in my first few months at Breather. The most important part of my job as the first and only employee in New York City was convincing landlords to lease us space in their buildings, which we would then re-rent to strangers. It was a predictably hard sell, and I heard no more times than I care to remember. Then, after weeks of nos, one landlord on East 27th Street said yes. There was only one problem: instead of a doorman, the building had a keypad that dialed out so that tenants could buzz in their guests. Given the fact that we had no one on site, our options were: 
<ol><li>Send someone to the building with a key for every reservation.
</li><li>Turn down the lease. 
</li><li>Get creative and figure something out. 
</li></ol>I chose C, and spent days googling derivations of remote access building and unlock door building phone. All of the solutions required installing hardware, which was a non-starter. And then I found Twilio. 
In the course of a couple of hours at a company Hackathon, I set up a Twilio account, got a custom phone number, asked the landlord to program the box to call that number, and wrote a script that played the DTMF tone that would unlock the door for our clients. I even recorded a message -- Hi, welcome to Breather! -- that played every time someone gained access. Then I took a subway up to 27th street, entered our suite number on the keypad, and held my breath. Five seconds later, I heard a click, and the door unlocked. I felt like a fucking wizard. 
Twilio gave me superpowers, which I used to sign leases on a whole swath of buildings that were previously inaccessible. A couple lines of code changed the course of the business. 
You would think, then, that when Twilio went public on June 23, 2016, I would have bought it on the first day. And you would be wrong. I ignored it, dismissing the company as a toy that let me unlock doors. That was a mistake. 
Since its June 2016 IPO, Twilio is up a casual 1,115%. Over the past year, its grown 222%, outperforming the BVP Emerging Cloud Index by 2.4x. 
Despite missing most of the runup, Im still bullish on Twilios future and started a small position in the company that I plan to add to over time. There are a few reasons: 
<ol><li>The API-First Business Model. For all of the reasons highlighted above, Im a fan of the API-first business model. Twilio has a large and growing customer base and is able to cross-sell new products like Flex and SendGrid in a Stripe-like Company-as-an-API model. I love it when a hypothesis plays out in the numbers, and in this case, Twilios moats translate into a BVP Emerging Cloud Index-leading 137% Net Dollar Expansion.
</li></ol><ol><li>Segment Acquisition. In October, Twilio announced that it was acquiring Segment, the leading customer data platform in a valuable position on top of many other API-first companies in the stack. In an interview with Ben Thompson, Lawson explained the deal by saying that to build a customer relationship, you need understanding and engagement. Twilio provided engagement, Segment brings the understanding. Thompson hypothesized that this could be the beginning of an ad product that could compete with Google and Facebook. If thats the case, the opportunity is multiples of Twilios current market cap. Even without that mega-bull case, the two companies have an estimated $79 billion market to attack, and Twilio plans to use its relationships with developers to go after it. 
</li></ol>
<ol><li>Segment took a $3.2 Billion All-Stock Deal. Segment was one of the hottest API-first companies in the market, sitting in a plum position in the stack, and it chose to sell its company for all Twilio stock (which is down slightly since the day of the announcement). I trust that Segment had a good reason for its decision.
</li><li>Developer Focused, API-First Juggernaut. When the Segment deal was announced, friend of Not Boring Logan Bartlett, a SaaS-focused VC at Redpoint Ventures tweeted:
</li></ol>Twilio can become the leading acquirer in the API-first ecosystem and expand the building blocks it gives companies to build on top of. The API-first market map will become competitive M&amp;A territory, and Twilio has shown that its unique combination of size and developer love, rivaled only by Stripe, is attractive to potential targets. 
These are just some rough thoughts (and obviously not investment advice). Twilio deserves a deep dive of its own. Luckily, investing in a company is my favorite way to force myself to get smart on an industry, and API-first feels like one that has a lot more to uncover. More doors to unlock, if you will. 
Thanks as always to Dan and Puja for editing, and to Ben and my other more technical friends for the input and ideas!
Just a few more things. Last week was a whirlwind of fun conversations and collaborations, check em out:
<ul><li>Acquired Slack x Salesforce Podcast :Acquired has been one of my must-listen podcasts for a few years, and their work is the starting point for a lot of my essays (including Tencent and SoftBank). It was surreal and so much fun to be able to join David and Ben to talk about Salesforces acquisition of Slack. 
</li><li>S-1 Club: Airbnb: Its finally here. Airbnb is going public this week (rumored to be pricing at a $42 billion market cap). I teamed up with Mario Gabriele and the S-1 Club to go deeeeep on the company in preparation. 
</li></ul><ul><li>Remote Work Conversation with Paul Millerd: Last week, I wrote about Remote Work. My friend Paul Millerd has been living the remote life since before it was cool, quitting his job at a top-tier consulting firm to go solo. Really fun convo.

2020-12-16,Collaboration Is The New Competition In FinTech,"Article by Melody Brue, Moor Insights &amp; Strategy Senior Analyst, FinTech

Nearly every industry had to pivot, in multiple ways, to adapt to the challenges brought on by 2020.  FinTech has been one of the most impacted, with people working, shopping, and banking from home due to social distancing. Although partially sprung from Covid, the trends in online banking, lending, and digital and contactless payments will likely continue. Furthermore, they'll continue in a surprisingly collaborative way. The race to win in the FinTech arena looks more like a relay race than a winner takes all endeavorit's a team sport, with everyone building solutions and products on top of existing financial services infrastructure. Lets take a closer look at this trend. 
The global pandemic has indeed accelerated the shift to digital commerce and payments, in some cases replacing the retail and merchant experience altogether. This is likely due, in part, to these FinTech businesses having to continue to work and function in various stages of lockdown while answering consumers' evolving financial services needs. These behaviors changed so fast, both at the consumer and commercial level, that the only real way to address them quickly was collaboration. The only path forward, as I see it, is for this to continue. 
At a Silicon Valley startup, where I come from, everyone wants to ""disrupt"" an industry.  However, FinTechs are proving that collaboration can be a more successful path. Many of the more popular startup payment methods you might have used to pay for your morning coffee were built upon banking institutions' existing infrastructure. This collaborative approach lends the established banks relevance and innovation while giving FinTech startups decades of trust, customer loyalty, and ultimately, security for its users. 
In both the startup and traditional financial spaces, the real winners are the ones who embrace embedded finance and the rising importance of the API. In my previous life as CMO of Lottery.com, we adopted a ""win together"" mentality throughout the company, especially when it came to processing complex payments in a highly regulated space. Rather than build new, complicated technology to process lottery tickets on the mobile device, the team assembled a tech stack that included PCI-compliant APIs for KYC as well as balance and location checks. Additionally, we partnered with processing behemoth First Data to accept debit, credit, and ACH payments. Through collaboration, the company was able to process transactions without functioning as both the platform and the bank. Collaboration is the new competition, and the industry seems to be embracing it.
Visa's recent multi-billion acquisition of Plaid and Mastercards M&amp;A spree (which includes notable acquisitions Finicity and Net), is indicative of the banks' current flurry to reinvent themselves. With the number of debit and credit card transactions shrinking as other digital payment methods gain traction, these moves are also a way for the traditional financial institutions to future-proof themselves. 
Ultimately, this collaborative partnership between banks, card networks, and new payment methods that build on top of existing financial services infrastructure will fuel the financial space, provide useful, time-saving tools for consumers and industry and increase connectivity across accounts.

2020-12-14,Antitrust Is Back: A Q&A With The Experts,"A law book with a gavel - Antitrust law
getty
After years of relative quiet, antitrust law is back on everyones minds.  
In the last few months, federal government agencies the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division have filed antitrust lawsuits against some of the biggest American companies. 
Between the FTC and the DOJ, which enforce the federal antitrust laws at times overlapping, but often complementing each others work the DOJ, along with eleven state attorneys generals, filed in October a lawsuit against Google for monopoly conduct in the search and ad markets. Then, in November, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to stop Visa's $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid Inc. a massive data aggregator. Finally, a few days ago, in December, along with 48 state attorney generals, the FTC filed a lawsuit accusing Facebook of suppressing its competition. 
Accusing U.S. tech giants of 'monopoly power' is not surprising. Efforts to crack the tech giants legal shield has gained bipartisan momentum and support for quite some time now. After all, Big Tech has become a big target on Capitol Hill, especially for those concerned with consumer protection and privacy rights. Big Tech has been criticized for their data collection and processing practices, market dominance, interference in our political systems, and influence on the world of online speech. 
In October 2020, Democratic congressional staffers set out their conclusions in a 449-page study following a 16-month inquiry into unfair practices at Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. They concluded that these companies have market dominance that needs to be reined in, whether it entails splitting the companies up, blocking potential purchases or pressuring them to open their platforms.
The recent antitrust enforcement efforts, however, attempt to fix not just the problems resulting from these players monopolistic power, but also social and political problems that have plagued our society. Is the main issue competition law, or is it privacy and data protection, and other issues? Should we try to correct the problems by blocking future purchases or breaking-up these companies, and what exactly are the issues we will next be facing? 
We asked several leading antitrust scholars  Christopher R. Leslie from the UC Irvine School of Law; Menesh Patel from the UC Davis School of Law; Greg Day from the University of Georgia; Konstantinos Stylianou from the School of Law, University of Leeds; and Scott Hemphill from the NYU School of Law about their thoughts. 
In the media and among some academics, an increasing narrative has been that antitrust lawmakers have systematically relaxed enforcement of existing competition laws. Is antitrust back in the U.S.? 
Leslie: Antitrust isnt back; it never left. Antitrust law sometimes doesnt get the attention that it deserves. Now it is. 
Day: Potentially. On one hand, the recent willingness to pursue high-profile cases indicates that the federal agencies have a renewed interested in enforcing the antitrust laws. But on the other hand, the appetite for enforcement might be limited to politically popular cases where the defendant is a technology company like Google or Facebook.
Patel: While antitrust doctrine has largely remained the same, antitrust enforcement has certainly changed along a few notable dimensions. First, as evidenced by the Google and Facebook suits, the agencies are now willing to challenge perceived anticompetitive conduct by large platform companies, who previously were considered untouchable by antitrust. Second, as evidenced by Visa-Plaid, antitrust enforcers are increasingly focusing on potential antitrust blind spots, such as the acquisition of nascent competitors.
Stylianou: The activity in antitrust enforcement is certainly welcome and perhaps long overdue. But I fear it was all done sloppily, with unclear theories of harm, weak evidence, and unsuitable remedies. Its like they took an antitrust textbook, correctly listed all the prerequisites to bring an antitrust case, and then proved none of it. The saddest thing is that you dont get an opportunity to bring cases like that often, and FTC/DOJ may have blown a great opportunity.
Do you think that the elections and Bidens win contributed to this antitrust momentum? 
 Leslie: The recent actions against high-tech companies were not driven by Bidens win. These cases take months to investigate and develop before filing complaints. That said, antitrust enforcement will likely increase during Bidens presidency, including innovative theories 
Day: I certainly do think that the elections provided momentum. This is one of the rare issues that has seemingly united the left and right sides of the aisle (though the theories of antitrust liability can be pretty diverse). It's, after all, notable that the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Amazon during the midst of a pandemic. Then the DOJ initiated an antitrust action against Google just a couple weeks before the presidential election. At the moment, you're not going to alienate too many voters with an antitrust lawsuit against Big Tech.
Patel:  Antitrust sentiment against the large platform companies has been building for some time. As evidenced by the state complaint against Facebook, there is broad bipartisan support for aggressive antitrust enforcement directed at the large platform companies, which is unique.
Stylianou: The previous Republican administration was pretty amenable to antitrust action and these cases have been brewing for some time now. Certainly, the pressure will not subside with the new administration.
How realistic is it at this point to undo the acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram? And if that happens, what measures should be put in place to guarantee that competition is increased in the U.S. personal social networking market? 
Leslie: Undoing the acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram is feasible in a way that dissolution was not possible in other high-tech cases, like the Microsoft case. WhatsApp and Instagram were freestanding companies with their own products and intellectual property, which could be spun back into independent companies without any ownership interest from Facebook. 
Day: I would imagine that breaking up Facebook's acquisitions would be extremely difficult. It's also questionable whether the remedy would be very successful. Even if consumers were initially harmed by the acquisitions, it's not precisely clear how consumers would tangibly benefit if the court divested Facebook of Instagram and WhatsApp.
Patel:  With respect to the potential breakup of Facebook and Instagram or Facebook and WhatsApp, there is of course the operational question of whether a breakup would be feasible given the extent of Facebooks integration of Instagram and WhatsApp, especially since those deals closed so many years ago. But there are two other, equally important, questions. The first is whether a breakup would be a suitable remedy. The remedies question would come up only if the FTC prevails on liability, and this would require the FTC to articulate and then prove a legally cognizable theory of antitrust harm caused by Facebooks acquisitions of Instagram or WhatsApp. If, for instance, the established competitive harm relates to a deterioration of consumer privacy, which is one of the theories advanced in the state complaint, then its not entirely clear whether a breakup, as opposed to a behavioral remedy, would alleviate that particular competitive harm. The second issue is whether the FTC will be able to prevail on liability. The agency faces a few unique challenges in this particular litigation. One important challenge relates to causation. In order to prevail, the FTC would have to show that consumers would have been better off but-for the two acquisitions. Establishing this required nexus between the two acquisitions and competitive harm will be difficult because both Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived post-acquisition and because so much time has passed since those deals closed. 
Stylianou: Breaking up companies can certainly be done. The question is whether youll end up with a better outcome than what you started off with. Even if they de-integrated Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook with surgical precision, whats the point? What do consumers gain? Instagram and WhatsApp grew to be tremendously good and popular products in Facebooks hands, and there is certainly no lack of competition in either social photo-sharing or messaging apps. Facebook has done a lot of things wrong, but neutralizing Instagram and WhatsApp, as the lawsuit claims, was not one of them. There is a lot of anger against Facebook, and for good reason, but the FTC misdirected that anger like a shotgun that fires in every direction in hopes something will stick.
Hemphill: Ordering divestiture is of course not a remedy to be taken lightly. But it can be the right choice in an appropriate case. In thinking about remedies, one important issue is the connection between the unlawful conduct and the proposed solution. Here, the unlawful conduct is a series of anticompetitive acquisitions. Undoing the deals is a remedy that is closely related to the harm. In this respect, the case is like Standard Oil, where the breakup reversed the consolidation of separate firms into Standard Oil of New Jersey.
Whos next?    
Leslie: The government is advancing some novel theories in its cases. It might be wise to see how those theories play out in court before going after another tech-tech giant. This would give antitrust enforcers an opportunity to refine their arguments. 
Day: I'm actually most interested in Epic Games's antitrust lawsuit against Apple. But I would imagine that the government will take a wait-and-see approach with how the DOJ's lawsuit against Google and the FTC's lawsuit against Facebook fare. 
Patel: The FTC and DOJ fairly routinely challenge consummated mergers and seek structural relief, such as a breakup. Whats unique about the FTCs action against Facebook is that the FTC is challenging two consummated deals that the FTC previously reviewed and cleared pursuant to the federal merger review scheme, Hart-Scott-Rodino. Its very rare for the agencies to mount ex-post challenges to deals that they previously reviewed and cleared, and especially deals that they cleared long ago. While it would enhance consumer welfare if the agencies mounted more of those ex-post challenges in a predictable and reasoned way, there is inertia in the agencies expanding that type of merger challenge. Another potential pivot in enforcement is for the agencies to more carefully scrutinize acquisitions of nascent competitors, including acquisitions that occur below the Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting thresholds.
Stylianou: Amazon and its dealings with third party sellers on its platform are the next obvious target. The pandemic certainly didnt help assuage fears about Amazons monopoly. Following up on the Visa-Plaid deal, I also predict an M&amp;A wave and potentially anticompetitive practices in the fintech sector as traditional banks try to find their way in the new markets.
To this end, it seems like many more questions remain unclear. For example, if privacy rather than price takes focus in the cases of Big Tech, and perhaps Visas too, should lawmakers not center their efforts on passing a national privacy and data protection law?  Such a law is clearly long overdue.  Likewise, is undoing Facebooks acquisitions going to be beneficial for consumers?  Is there mounting evidence that the dominance of online platforms has materially weakened innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy? Or, perhaps, these measures can have the opposite effect and hurt innovation and entrepreneurship?
One thing is for sure  economists have been warning for quite some time that the U.S. is facing a historic tipping point, where countries around the world are stepping on the gas to promote innovation policies, while the U.S. is lagging behind. Can and will the Biden Administration address some of these issues? Is antitrust law the best tool for the task? Maybe, time will tell.","After years of relative quiet, antitrust law is back on everyone’s minds."
2020-12-19,Apple Pay: Payments Systems Are Getting More And More Attention,"The coronavirus pandemic is causing lots and lots of changes in the world. Economically, this is causing a massive shift in the way people do their business and how they channel their money.
In terms of channeling their money, payment systems have a lot to do with the economics of how people execute their actual transactions.
As far as the payments system goes , it appears as if the crisis is accelerating things into the future at a much faster pace than had originally been expected. Furthermore, this acceleration is having the effect that a once seemingly insignificant area of the financial world is now gaining major headlines.
Unfortunately, some of attention is coming from a very unwanted sourcethe regulatory side of the world and changes in regulation could have a significant impact on the economics of payments and who is conducting them.
Earlier, we saw the U. S. Justice Department take out after Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V) concerning its acquisition of Plaid, Inc., a data-networking company.
The Justice Department apparently assumes that Plaid is a competitive threat to debit cards. That is, Plaid is another, different type of product than a debit card and hence as Plaid succeeds, consumers will lose a choice and this is bad.
As such, Justice is pushing the case that Visa is acquiring a competitor and therefore is reducing future competition.
Now, it appears as if there will be formal attempts to create a formal antitrust probe into the actions of Apple Pay.
New Areas Of Concern
In this past year, Apple, Inc, (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been fighting regulatory concerns over the competitive behavior of its App Store.
The financial services side of the business has been ignored.
But, now, the increased activity being experienced by Apple Pay is causing more and more attention to move their way.
Some 507 million people, half of all the people in the world who own an iPhone, now use Apple Pay. This is up from 67 million just four years ago.
This is an economically significant increase. And, it is only going to increase.
Feelings are growing so strong that Visa, in a survey, found that nearly half of consumers would not shop at stores that fail to offer touchless checkout.
This is an important economic transformation.
Patrick McGee, writing in the Financial Times, quotes Jason Garner, chief executive of California-based payments platform Marqeta:
Apple Wallet is a killer appmore of a killer app than much of the world really understands right now. And its absolutely going to become a battleground for regulators in the future.
Antitrust probes are forming in the European Commission, the Netherlands, and Australias central bank. And, more appear to be following this lead.
This is economically significant.
The Battle
The basic concern is that Apple Pay, on such apps as iPhones and Apple Watches, restricts users from taking advantage of the near-field communication technology (NFC) that allows tap-and-go payment.
This the argument goes, economically constricts the market, much to Apple Pay's favor. 
Apple, however, claims that they do this to preserve data privacy.
This is, of course, a debatable point.
Furthermore, the Wallet app comes pre-installed and cannot be deleted.
And, such actions are frowned upon.
With the accelerated use of Apple Pay, regulators are very fearful that, economically, this will, in the future, limit competition.
Apple Pays Performance
Over the previous twelve months, the App Store earned more than $20 billion in net revenue. An expert states that, if Apple can dodge the regulators, Apple Pay could soon exceed the App Store in the revenue it takes in. This would be massive and, economically, very significant.
In addition, this analysis does not include Apple Pay broadening its offerings into other fields of financial services. This will cause regulators to really consider whether or not Apple Pay is a technology company or is it a financial company.
This will get Apple into the discussion faced by Ant Group Co., the parent of Alipay, the Chinese payments giant. Ant Group Co. and Alipay due so much attention that Chinese regulators pulled Ant's IPO, the largest IPO ever offered to the world from its offering. The Chinese regulators moved because Ant had been considered a technology company in the past, but was now being consider a financial firm and, therefore, subject to different regulations. This has had significant economic ramifications, worldwide.
But, speaking about China, one needs to note that Apple Pay has not done much in China. Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate the market. In addition, these two companies have shown how a payments foundation can be used to produce a platform of microloans, wealth management, insurance, and paying bills. How is that, economically, changing the banking world, not only in China, but also threatening banking everywhere?
Bottom Line
Apple Pay is a major economic force in the United States...and the world...and will continue to be in the future. One could even say that Apple Pay, economically, as well as technologically, is one of the major players driving the future of finance in the worldand this, eventually, if not now, is going to be the real battleground. 
As Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has stated the coronavirus has put the U. S. on a different trajectory when it comes to adopting contactless payments. And, then he warned others that there are more things that Apple can do in this space.
Apple and Apple pay, along with Ant Group and Alipay, and PayPal and Amazon Pay and Google Pay and others are changing the financial world and forcing other institutions like JPMorgan, Chase &amp; Co., one of the leaders in technology of the commercial banking world, to move their payments efforts into high gear. 
These changes are also going to have a profound impact on which banking institutions survive into the future. The economic implications are huge and investors must keep an eye on these changes in looking at the banking industry in the future. Lots and lots of wealth will be re-distributed because of these changes.
This is the future. Apple and Apple Pay are going to be a major part of it. And, banking will never be the same. Even the regulators are starting to understand this.

2020-12-26,3 Explosive Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 10 Years,"It's easy to get lured by the stock market's day-to-day movements and cash out when your stock pops, but real money is made only when you can hold on to your stocks for years. That's when you let compounding interest work its magic, earning you mind-boggling returns, especially when the underlying companies of the shares you own have surefire growth prospects.
Case in point: the three companies discussed below. These are incredible growth stocks riding megatrends that could bring you exceptional wealth, provided you buy and hold these stocks for at least the next decade.
E-commerce is sending this stock to new highs
2020 might have been an exceptional year for the e-commerce sector thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic fueling virtual shopping, but the pandemic may have only accelerated the online shopping megatrend. Statista, for instance, estimates revenue in the global e-commerce market will grow at a compound annual clip of 7.4% between 2020 and 2025. With a convenient platform that enables merchants of all sizes to easily set up online stores and manage the entire process of sales, Shopify(NYSE:SHOP) is ready to ride the wave.
Image source: Getty Images.
More than one million merchants across 175 countries are part of Shopify's ecosystem today. In the third quarter (Q3), Shopify's gross merchandise volume, or the total value of orders processed through its platform, more than doubled to $30.9 billion. Its revenue jumped 96%, and it turned a profit of $191.1 million versus a net loss in Q3 2019. Shopify's holiday sales hit a record $5.1 billion between this Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Shopify also continued its partnership spree in Q3 and launched its TikTok channel to enable merchants to market their products. The company already has similar collaborations with Facebook, Snap's Snapchat, and more. Plus, management continues to expand its logistics arm, Shopify Fulfillment Network, which could give the company a shot in the arm in the e-commerce space. 
In short, there's a lot to like about Shopify. Even if you want to wait a bit before buying the stock since its recent rally, you'd likely reap rich returns in the long run regardless of your entry price point, given e-commerce's prospects.
This megatrend is only getting started
If e-commerce is bread and butter for Shopify, it's also the biggest tailwind for Visa(NYSE:V) for one simple reason: Online shopping and digital payments go hand-in-hand. More and more people across the globe are ditching cash and warming up to cashless modes of payments like credit and debit cards, opening up massive opportunities for Visa.
V Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Visa is a growth machine and a cash cow. Because Visa primarily processes transactions made using its co-branded cards over its payments network, it's an asset-light, high-margin business model. Of course, there's a lot more to Visa than just payments processing; it also provides value-added services like fraud management, analytics, and security solutions. So, although Visa's payments volumes were muted in the year ended Sept. 30, 2020, its other revenues grew 9%.
While a booming global middle class and the ongoing ""war on cash"" should drive Visa's core consumer-payments business, new payments markets like business-to-business and business-to-consumer are pegged to be worth nearly $185 trillion. Visa is extensively expanding its presence in these areas. Visa's impending $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, a fintech company, may have run into regulatory hurdles, but the move reflects its hunger to grow in lucrative markets like the fintech one. This hunger, combined with the cashless megatrend, could bring in explosive returns for Visa shareholders in the coming decades.
A growth stock you've never heard of
An infrastructure stock is possibly the last to come to mind when you think of growth stocks, but that's the beauty of investing in Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP)(NYSE:BIPC). Though more popular for its dividends, Brookfield is a dream stock to own for both income and growth investors. Here's how the stock has fared since the company's inception in 2008.
BIP data by YCharts.
The stock wouldn't have rallied so much if not for Brookfield's solid operational performance over the years, combined with dividend growth. Brookfield's dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 10% since 2008. The thing is, Brookfield owns and operates critical infrastructure assets in utilities, transport, energy, and data. Most of these are essential to the running of the economy and are typically regulated or contracted in nature, so they can generate steady and stable cash flows.
BIP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
One of Brookfield's biggest strengths is a strong balance sheet, which allows it to exploit timely growth opportunities. For example, taking advantage of a weak oil and gas market, Brookfield's parent company, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), acquired interest in Cheniere Energy Partners. For Brookfield Infrastructure, an investment worth around $425 million has given it a stake in Cheniere's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility, which generates 85% revenue under long-term contracts. In another example, Brookfield recently acquired 135,000 towers in India to make headway into one of the world's largest telecom markets.
These are just two examples that reflect the kind of growth ahead for Brookfield. With management also aiming for 5% to 9% annual dividend growth and the stock consistently yielding 3.8%, Brookfield Infrastructure is a no-brainer, wealth-builder stock to buy and forget.",Long-term investors could be staring at multi-bagger returns with these stocks.
2020-12-03,The Data Land-Grab Continues: S&P Global To Acquire IHS Markit,"In the largest announced corporate transaction of the year, this week S&amp;P Global entered into a $44 billion agreement to acquire IHS Markit, thereby forming a data solutions and services behemoth intended to rival Bloomberg, Intercontinental Exchange, and Refinitiv Holdings. 
Despite a pandemic-impeded global economy, 2020 has been a year of big deals about big data. This announcement follows other multi-billion dollar corporate transactions involving data-centric and digital businesses such as: 
<ul><li>Morgan Stanley acquiring E*TRADE for $13 billion</li><li>Just Eat Takeaway acquiring Grubhub for $7.3 billion</li><li>Intuit acquiring Credit Karma for $7.1 billion</li><li>Visa acquiring Plaid for $5.3 billion</li><li>Uber acquiring Postmates for $2.65 billion</li></ul>Data Deal Implications
Moreover, the S&amp;P Global-IHS Markit deal exemplifies the data land-grab that has been underway for the past decade, featuring Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn, IBM acquiring the Weather Channel, NASDAQ acquiring Quandl, and even the acquisition of IHS by Markit just four years ago. Certainly, one-stop-shopping for data has its attraction, but data product buyers are a bit more cautionary. This marriage is not one I appreciate, commented Claus Thorball, head of data procurement at DanskeBank. By applying the S&amp;P business mindset to the IHS Markit portfolio of services we are looking at a billion-dollar wedding, and customers will get stuck with the bill. Other data procurement managers have voiced similar concerns over the monopolization of financial data products and services driving up prices, and therefore expect regulatory scrutiny of the deal.
Duncan Chapple, head of analyst relations at CCgroup, posited that while S&amp;P will be too busy digesting to work out what it has, he also noted that the introduction of IHS Markits deep vertical expertise and data results in a strong set of vertical offerings that, similar to Gartners and Forresters horizontal research and advisory services, could see rapid adoption by enterprises.

Investors Love Data Businesses as Much as They Love Data
Indeed, markets in recent years have favored data-oriented business models. With market-to-book values nearly three-times higher than the market average, investors have come to reap, if not explicitly understand, the unique economic qualities of data. 
Compared with financial and physical assets, data can be re-used and re-sold without it being used-up, the same data can be repackaged and licensed in nearly unlimited forms and formats, and using data typically generates evermore valuable data. Data is what economists refer to as a non-rivalrous, non-depleting, regenerative asset. Moreover, datas inventory carrying costs and distribution costs compare favorably to most other kinds of assets, making it an attractive commodity to purveyors and investors alike. 
Alternatives for Alternative Data
Data product company consolidation, however, are not the only data business play. Much like how Amazon, Ebay and Etsy offer online sales and distribution platforms for millions of manufacturers, independent data aggregators and marketplaces have sprung up over the past several years. Companies like DAWEX, Demyst Data, Eagle Alpha, and Datarade offer one-stop shopping for financial, demographic, corporate, legal, weather, consumer, scientific, geographic and other data compiled or generated by thousands of data providers big and small. 
Not only do these nascent data marketplaces aggregate commercial data sources, but unlike the mega information services companies or data brokers, they provide match-making services for companies that want to find buyers for their own data. 
Innovating with Information
Who is purchasing all these data products? Trading firms endlessly seeking new sources of alpha have modern-day data science sweatshops continually plugging new alternative data feeds into new and adapted analytical models. Retailers soak up social media, consumer and price elasticity data to better target customers with next best offers. Manufacturers integrate ratings and reviews to improve customer service and product designs. Construction companies and home-builders track population shifts, climate change and public utility plans. Logistics companies use realtime and long-range traffic and weather data to optimize routes and distribution channels. 
And clever app developers around the world take advantage of all sorts of obscure data sources. For example, Icelands popular Íslendingabók mobile app integrates the countrys genealogy database to determine how closely related two people are so they can bump their phones before they bump in bed, per the apps tagline. 
The opportunities to leverage external data in high-value and innovative ways in every sector are limited only by the imagination of business leaders or the consultants they hire. 
Data as the 21st-Century Factor of Production
Jeffrey Maron, global head of product at Compagnie Financière Tradition, commenting on the acquisition, says, Data is the lifeblood of finance and this deal acknowledges the value of high quality data.
Not just in the world of finance, data has become a fifth factor of production, creeping up upon or in some instances even supplanting the importance of land, labor, capital or entrepreneurship. IDC estimates that the market for external data approached $200 billion last year. This is likely to accelerate rapidly as businesses realize the pandemic broke their traditional trend-based models that analyzed only the companys own historical data rather than incorporating external leading indicators.
Over three decades ago FedExs founder and CEO, Fred Smith, proclaimed that The information about the package is just as important as the package itself. Since then, this realization and mindset have swept across every corner of commerce spawning a sprawling marketplace for data, and endless opportunities for businesses to capitalize upon it.",The S&P Global-IHS Markit deal exemplifies the data land-grab that has been underway for the past decade.
2021-01-13,Visa abandons $5.7B Plaid acquisition following antitrust lawsuit,"Visa Inc. has abandoned its $5.7 billion acquisition of financial technology startup Plaid Financial Inc. following a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice challenging the deal on antitrust grounds.
The deal was announced in January 2020 with the Justice Department first rumored to be investigating the acquisition in October. The investigation resulted in the department announcing in November that it was suing Visa on the grounds that the deal amounts to an attempt to eliminate a nascent competitive threat in violation of both the Sherman Antitrust Act and Clayton Antitrust Act.
Plaid, founded in 2013, offers a financial application programming interface that connects apps and services with financial services. The company provides the technology that links apps and services such as Transferwise Ltd., Venmo Inc., Robinhood Markets Inc., Betterment LLC and Chime with traditional financial service providers. Although not a household name, one in four people with a U.S. bank account is said to have used Plaid to connect their accounts with over 2,500 digital finance products.
Visa, it is alleged, saw what Plaid offers as having the potential to threaten one of its core businesses – online transactions. By acquiring Plaid, the Justice Department argued that the transaction would have enabled Visa to eliminate the threat to its online business thereby enhancing or maintaining its monopoly.
American consumers and business owners rely on the internet to buy and sell goods and services, and Visa which has immense power in online debit in the United States – has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division said in a statement. “Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visas online debit services. With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.
In a separate statement, Visa chairman and chief executive officer Al Kelly said that he believed that the companies would have eventually won a legal battle as Plaid’s services were complementary to Visa’s. “However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve,” he said.
Zachary Perret, co-founder and CEO of Plaid wrote in a blog post that “unfortunately, the pace of a multi-year regulatory review is not compatible with the fast-moving realities of a startup and delaying close another year or more is not in the best interest of our customers, the financial system, or consumers themselves.”
Plaid certainly shouldn’t have any issues as a standalone company although there is nothing actually stopping Visa now in trying to compete with it directly. According to Crunchbase, Plaid has raised $309.3 million in venture capital funding from firms including Andreesen Horowitz, American Express Ventures, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Goldman Sachs, Norwest Venture Partners and Index Ventures.

2021-01-14,"Visa exits $5.3 billion Plaid buy, leaving data-sharing standards up to regulators","Visa's exit follows a lawsuit
 filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in November challenging the $5.3 billion takeover of data aggregator Plaid, which was first announced
 almost exactly one year ago, per
 The Wall Street Journal. 
 Visa-Plaid merger termination magnifies need for US open banking regulation.
Insider Intelligence
The DOJ alleged that the acquisition would give Visa a monopoly in the online debit card market and limit competition in the payments industry. Plaid CEO Zach Perret said
 in a statement that the company will work with Visa as an investor and partner going forward.
The termination could delay Visa's entry into open banking in the US, which likely stings even more as Mastercard sails into the space with its purchase of data aggregator startup Finicity. The DOJ greenlit
 the $825 million acquisition in November, an unsurprising move given Mastercard's much smaller share of the online debit market.
Finicity's open banking prowess will allow Mastercard to offer its customers greater control over usage of their data, strengthen
 its open banking platform, and provide more financial services options. With the Plaid deal off the table, Visa will have to find another means of doing the same.
The DOJ's apparent distaste toward the idea of an open banking giant will perpetuate the fragmented US open banking environment—leaving the door open for regulators to implement a standardized approach.
<ul><li>Consumers' access to financial data sharing in the US has largely depended on private-sector efforts. For example, Plaid is a member of the Financial Data Exchange, a 168-member financial industry consortium
 that has adopted its own data-sharing principles. But consortia carry no regulatory obligations to comply, and they don't preclude other standards from popping up: A number of banks are making another play with Akoya
, a financial data-sharing startup. The Visa-Plaid tie-up could have been big enough to force unity across the financial services industry—but the DOJ shooting it down suggests that a centralized regulatory approach will in fact be necessary.</li><li>Standardized rules would make data sharing more convenient for customers and ease banks' implementation of open banking. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been working to determine
 how consumers' access to their financial information is regulated. And Insider Intelligence expects
 that the soon-to-be Biden-led agency will fast-track legal standards around open finance. If the CFPB drafts rules that mandate greater consumer control over their own financial data, it could spur a vast array of new services and help consumers take better control of their financial lives. And for banks, a regulated approach could make it easier to implement open banking-enabled products, as they will only need to follow a single standard.</li></ul>Want to read more stories like this one?

2021-01-14,Plaid Likely To Go Public After Failed Sale to Visa,"The odds are low that Plaid will seek out another merger partner now that its $5.3 billion sale to Visa is off. Instead, the fintech is more likely to go public via a traditional initial public offering, a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or a direct listing, five fintech bankers and venture capitalists told Barrons. Plaid is likely to IPO or get SPACd, one venture capitalist said. 
Its SPAC city, another banker added. 
A Plaid spokeswoman declined to comment. 
SPACs have emerged as the busiest sector of the IPO market. There were 248 so-called blank-check companies that went public in 2020more than half the number of all IPOs that yearraising $82.3 billion, Dealogic said. The $82.3 billion is nearly 50% of the $167.4 billion raised by the entire IPO market in 2020. 
Blank-check companies have been aggressive with fintechs. Earlier this month, 
 Social Capital Hedosophia
 (ticker: IPOE), the latest blank-check company from venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, agreed to merge with online personal finance company Social Finance, or SoFi, in an $8.6 billion deal. 
 Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II
 (BFT), the SPAC from William P. Foley II, is buying payments platform Paysafe for $9 billion in December. United Wholesale Mortgage, a leading mortgage lender, is merging with Gores Holdings IV (GHIV), the blank-check company from the Gores Group, in a $16.1 billion transaction. United Wholesale is scheduled to trade on the New York Stock Exchange later this month. 
Founded in 2013, Plaids platform lets users connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. For example, Plaids technology lets Venmos customers pay their friends and family. Plaid works with other well-known fintechs, including investment platform Robinhood; Transferwise, which offers international money transfers; and Coinbase, a digital currency exchange. It employs 600 people. 
The San Francisco fintech has raised $310 million in funding. That includes a $2.8 million seed round from 2013 and a $12.5 million round in 2014, Crunchbase said. Both Visa (V) and 
 Mastercard
 (MA) invested in Plaids $250 million Series C round in 2018. 
It will be hard for Plaid investors to wait too long for an exit given how close they came, a second banker said, referring to the near sale to Visa.
The Plaid spokeswoman said its investors are committed to supporting Plaids path as an independent company and our long term growth trajectory. 
Visa agreed in January 2020 to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion. The deal, which didnt include a breakup fee, would have been Visas biggest ever. The companies late Tuesday agreed to terminate the $5.3 billion transaction after the Department of Justice sued to block the deal. The DOJ alleged the acquisition would allow Visa to eliminate a competitive threat to its online debit business before Plaid had a chance to succeed. Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visas online debit services, said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim in a statement. 
Visa, in a separate statement, said it was confident it wouldve won the litigation. But the pace of a multiyear regulatory review was not compatible with the fast-moving realities of a startup and delaying close another year or more is not in the best interest of our customers, the financial system, or consumers themselves, said Zach Perret, Plaids co-founder and CEO, in a blog post.
Plaids customer base has grown by 60% in the past year as more people have gone digital, a spokeswoman said. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused many consumers to no longer want to use cash or physically enter bank branches. Plaid is focused on building out [its] products and continuing to accommodate the generous growth potential that exists for Plaid as digital finance becomes more pervasive, the spokeswoman said. 
The DOJ lawsuit against Visa is the latest sign that regulators are concerned about the power held by Silicon Valley giants like 
 Facebook
 (FB), 
 Microsoft
 (MSFT), and 
 Alphabet 
 (GOOG). Facebook in particular has been widely criticized for allowing disinformation to spread on its site, which is said to have contributed to the attack on the U.S. Capitol last week. 
Im not surprised they scuttled it, said Matthew Epstein, managing partner and founder of Newbold Partners, a boutique fintech-focused investment bank, of the Visa-Plaid merger. Regulators are concerned that large tech companies are buying up nascent new providers early in their life cycle, Epstein said. 
The consensus in Washington is that there has been insufficient enforcement of antitrust rules and that this is causing problems, Epstein said. The change in administrations is not going to change [the scrutiny]. Visa may have decided that this is a situation where they cant fight City Hall.

2020-12-05,Meet Plaid's breakout stars: Here are the 14 people leading key initiatives across the $5.3 billion fintech that's looking to make financial data more accessible,"Fintech has been given a big boost this year as consumers embrace digital-first habits when it comes to their personal finances. From digital-only banks like Chime to roboadvisors like Betterment and apps like Venmo, consumers are embracing financial offerings outside of the major banks. And growth in fintech is slated to continue. 
Behind the scenes sits Plaid, which helps to connect new and traditional players.
Plaid serves as the behind-the-scenes piping, linking third-party apps to banks and enabling access to financial data needed for consumers to link bank accounts and move money.
Despite serving as a critical layer between fintechs and banks, Plaid has traditionally been largely unknown to most consumers. But increasingly, Plaid is coming into the public eye.
Many fintechs display Plaid's logo when consumers set up their accounts. And Plaid is currently in beta with a consumer-facing data management portal that allows users to review and monitor their live data connections, and even switch connections off and delete stored data. 
This all comes as consumers' awareness of data access and privacy is at an all time high. 
The startup, which was founded in 2012 and has raised over $300 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins, was further pushed into the spotlight following Visa's $5.3 billion bid to acquire it in January. The deal, however, has come under the scrutiny of regulators.

In November, the Department of Justice sued Visa over the planned acquisition, citing antitrust concerns. According to the DOJ, Plaid is a potential competitor to Visa, well-equipped to build a direct-to-bank payments system that would threaten Visa's debit card market share. In December, Visa responded in a filing, pushing back on the DOJ's claims. Visa said that Plaid is not a competitor, rather the two operate in ""complementary spheres,"" and that Plaid's payments-related R&amp;D does not constitute a competitive offering. 
To be sure, Plaid isn't the only player looking to connect fintechs with banks.
Finicity is another Plaid competitor. In June, Visa rival Mastercard announced plans to acquire Finicity in a deal worth $825 million. The DOJ cleared the proposed bid, and it is expected to close by the end of the year. And Akoya, backed by 12 financial institutions including Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo, just signed US Bank as its first data-sharing bank partner. There's also Evestnet Yodlee, which, like Plaid, has data-sharing agreements with the major banks.
Plaid sits front and center to the industry's move toward open finance
Banks haven't always been keen to share their data with startups like Plaid. And there are a number of reasons for that: risk, security, and competitive concerns, to name a few. 
""When I first joined, there was a little more resistance to the concept that consumers really own their data,"" Brandis Anderson, product and regulatory counsel at Plaid told Business Insider. Anderson joined Plaid in 2017.
But with the now-undeniable scale of fintech, and regulators' increased attention on data privacy, larger industry players are more open to the idea of collaborating with fintechs when it comes to data sharing. 
A consumer's right to access their financial data was stipulated in the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal law established in the wake of the financial crisis, but the terms are vague. Federal regulators haven't issued specific data sharing standards when it comes to banking data — at least not yet. 
In October, the CFPB announced plans to issue rules based on Dodd-Frank when it comes to financial data that moves between banks, third-party fintechs, and the pipes that connect the two. That means players like Plaid, among others, will spend the next year answering the CFPB's questions and helping structure proposed industry standards for data sharing.
""It could not be a more exciting time for open finance and open banking,"" Anderson said.
Read more: Digital-only banks have doubled their consumer bases and raised $4.6 billion in funding this year. Here's how startups like Chime, Dave, and Acorns are making big strides in 2020.
Open banking refers to access to bank data like account numbers and balances. Open finance is broader, including more pieces of consumers' financial lives such as payroll, insurance, credit cards, and investments. 
Plaid, for one, has layered more than just bank-account data into its application programming interfaces. During the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program rollout, Plaid built a new API for the payroll data small businesses needed to apply for the loans. Plaid also has APIs for investments and credit data.
And open finance can lead to more accessible financial tools for all consumers, especially un- and underbanked populations.  
""The fintech ecosystem has opened up a whole breadth of new use cases and new tools for consumers. But I think there's still a lot of work left to be done there,"" Katie Neal, outreach and advocacy manager at Plaid, told Business Insider.
""So one of the things that Plaid is thinking a lot about is how we foster development of products for consumers that are not traditionally engaged with the financial ecosystem,"" Neal added.
Tech bros need not apply
Plaid's has nearly 600 employees, around 200 of which were hired in 2020, alone. And as is often the case with a fast-growing company, scaling headcount presents its own challenges to building and maintaining company culture. 
""We incorporate our company values and principles in the hiring process, so people that we bring into the company typically align with our mission and values from the beginning,"" recruiting manager Erin Symons told Business Insider.
As startups scale, it's often hard to maintain the same company culture from the early days. But employees said that Plaid still shies away from the ""tech bro"" culture of Silicon Valley. 
""Plaid is really conscientious about making sure that we're not like the traditional bro-y tech company, for lack of a better word,"" Neal said. 
Kira Booth, an engineering manager who built out Plaid's Salt Lake City office, echoed Neal's comments.
""I think that we have built one of the best engineering cultures in Salt Lake, and have provided a real opportunity for people who don't want to be part of the tech bro culture of Silicon Slopes,"" Booth said.
From hosting women in tech events to ""plairings"" (where employees are randomly paired with a colleague and given $20 for an outing), Plaid invests in its employees and its culture. 
And thoughtful hiring is crucial for a work culture that expects all employees to contribute new ideas and strategies.
""We have a very bottom-up engineering culture across the board,"" Booth said. ""All of the engineers contribute to our [objectives and key results]. They help set strategy. They can give feedback directly to the head of engineering, and he takes it very seriously.""

2021-01-13,Department of Justice celebrates termination of Visa and Plaid's $5.3 billion merger,"Visa and Plaid have abandoned plans to merge, with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) to dismiss the litigation related to the proposed transaction.
The companies announced the $5.3 billion acquisition a year ago to the day.
At the time, Visa said roughly one in four people with a US bank account had used Plaid to share data with and connect to a finance app. It said Plaid's core focus on fintech would open new market opportunities both in the US and internationally, giving Visa an opportunity also to sell enhanced payment capabilities and related value-added services to fintech developers.
But in November, the DoJ filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in order to block the transaction. 
The DoJ alleged that Visa is a monopolist in online debit, charging consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments. As a fintech, Plaid, it said, has been developing a payments platform that would challenge Visa's monopoly.
The department said the transaction would have enabled Visa to eliminate this competitive threat to its online debit business before Plaid had a chance to succeed, thereby enhancing or maintaining its monopoly.  
The case was scheduled for trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on 28 June 2021.  
""We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaid's capabilities are complementary to Visa's, not competitive,"" Visa chairman and CEO Al Kelly said. ""We believe the combination of Visa with Plaid would have delivered significant benefits, including greater innovation for developers, financial institutions, and consumers. 
""However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.""
As a result of Visa and Plaid's decision to terminate the merger agreement, the United States had filed a joint stipulation of dismissal.
""In a victory for American consumers and small businesses, Visa has abandoned its efforts to acquire an innovative and nascent competitor,"" Assistant Attorney-General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division said. 
""American consumers and business owners rely on the internet to buy and sell goods and services, and Visa -- which has immense power in online debit in the United States -- has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions. 
""Now that Visa has abandoned its anticompetitive merger, Plaid and other future fintech innovators are free to develop potential alternatives to Visa's online debit services.  With more competition, consumers can expect lower prices and better services.""
Visa's 2019 revenue was approximately $23 billion, while in the same year, Plaid earned approximately $100 million in revenue. 
RELATED COVERAGE","With no movement a year after plans were announced, the companies have walked away from the merger and litigation has been dismissed."
2020-12-13,Why the feds flip-flopped on Facebook,"This weeks antitrust suits against Facebook by the FTC and dozens of state attorneys general came a month after the Justice Department went to court to block Visa from buying a financial data startup called Plaid
 on the grounds that, much like Facebook, the credit card giant is trying to neutralize a rising competitor by buying it. The FTC has also challenged two other recent proposed deals, one involving pharmaceuticals
 and the other DNA-sequencing technology
, that it alleged were intended to cut off competition that didnt yet exist.
That legal revolution, as one antitrust expert called it, has yet to be tested in court. But people following the issue say the Facebook suits could pave the way for more of these kinds of challenges.
The legal and political environment around antitrust in Big Tech is super different now from 2012, said John Newman, who spent three years as an antitrust prosecutor at the Justice Department. Back then, people were out there making the claim that when a market is free there cant be harm to consumers and antitrust doesnt apply.
Its just a complete 180, said Newman,now an antitrust professor at the University of Miami School of Law.
First though, the FTC and states will have to convince a federal judge that Instagram and WhatsApp would have been as successful as they are today even if Facebook had never bought them,said Kristen Limarzi, who spent 11 years as a DOJ antitrust lawyer. Facebook is already disputing that argument.
The FTCs case has to be built on more than just regret, said Limarzi,who joined the law firm Gibson Dunn last year. The merger has to be evaluated based on the facts in 2012 when it happened.
Even some lawmakers who support the FTCs Facebook suit expressed bemusement about the agencys 180-degree shift in its thinking toward the WhatsApp and Instagram deals.
I am glad to see that our antitrust enforcers are finally taking the threats posed by Big Tech seriously, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said in a statement Wednesday about what he called the FTCs belated lawsuit. He added, At the same time, the FTC previously cleared both the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, and I hesitate to congratulate it now for trying to clean up its own mess.
The commission has shown signs earlier this year that it is taking a new look at tech industry transactions that it had originally deemed too small to warrant its scrutiny. In February, the FTC announced that it had issued investigative subpoenas to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Googles parent Alphabet
, demanding information on 10 years worth of mergers, as part of a study into acquisitions of startups.
Its still unclear how much President-elect Joe Bidens administration will embrace the changing zeitgeist. The FTCs two Democrats, Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, both voted for the Facebook suit this week along with the agencys Republican chair, Joseph Simons, while the other two Republican commissioners voted against it. Simons is expected to step down in the next month, leaving the FTC with a 2-2 partisan split.
Instagram and WhatsApps parallel universe
Facebook disputes the reasoning behind the FTCs case, maintaining that its stewardship has causedInstagram and WhatsApp to thrive by investing significant funds and other resources into both.
When Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, the smaller company was a promising startup with only 30 million users to Facebooks 1 billion. WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 in a deal valued at nearly $21 billion, was a messaging app with a big following outside the U.S. By then Facebook had gone public and was looking to expand into new areas.
I think it's really worth remembering that when we bought Instagram and WhatsApp, they were really small little companies, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in a Friday interview on the Tamron Hall Show
. Instagram had 13 employees, 13. WhatsApp had 55 employees. And so we bought them, we bought them a long time ago, we invested, we grew them, and now they're really big.
To counter that argument, the FTC and states could try to show that some other company would have bought or invested in Instagram and WhatsApp if the social network hadnt. The FTCs complaint cites emails among CEO Mark Zuckerberg and otherFacebook executives expressing concerns about Apple, Google or Twitter using Instagram to gain a foothold in the social media market.
Menesh Patel, an acting professor atthe University of California-Davis School of Law, said such a strategy would let the FTC and states avoid having to show that either app would have become as successful on its own.
The plaintiffs case would still involve talking about a hypothetical world that doesnt exist, noted Patel, who specializes in antitrust. But Im sure any companies that were seeking to acquire WhatsApp and Instagram could provide testimony.
Facebook has also argued that the FTCs suit represents an unfair do-over for an agency that previously looked at and cleared the two mergers.
In addition to being revisionist history, this is simply not how the antitrust laws are supposed to work, Jennifer Newstead, the companys general counsel, said in a blog post
 Wednesday. No American antitrust enforcer has ever brought a case like this before, and for good reason.
Thats not entirely accurate, said Shaoul Sussman, a legal fellow for the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group that promotes small business.
Its unusual in the context of the last 20 years, Sussman said of the FTCs Facebook case. Its not within the wheelhouse of run-of-the-mill FTC actions, but that doesnt mean its unprecedented or breaking new ground.
Breaking up is hard to do
The currentway that federal regulators address mergers, in which companies must notify the FTC and DOJ about deals above a certain size, has existedonly since 1976, noted Sussman, an associate at the law firm Pearl Cohen in New York. Before that, regulators reviewedmergers and, if necessary, unwound them after the fact, he said.
The FTC is always careful to leave open the possibility of challenging deals later, even if it rarely does so. Inits
2012 letter closing its investigation into the Instagram
purchase
, the FTC said it had found no violation at this time.
This action is not to be construed as a determination that a violation may not have occurred, the FTC said. The Commission reserves the right to take such further action as the public interest may require.
Its also not unheard of for the two U.S. antitrust agencies to challenge mergers they had initially OKd, Patel said. In a paper set to be published in the Wisconsin Law Review
, Patel found that the FTC or DOJ have challenged four mergers they had previously cleared since 2001. The most well-known case involves a 2004 FTC challenge of an Illinois hospital merger
 that had taken place four yearsearlier.
If the FTC and states succeed in persuading the court that the Instagram and WhatsApp deals are illegal, the hardest question might be what to do about them. Both complaints ask for Facebook to be forced to sell off the twoservices. Thats not as easy as one might think, said Jay Himes, an antitrust partner at the firmLabaton.
From 2014 to 2018, Himes served as a court-appointed monitor to help unwind the merger of Bazaarvoice and PowerReviews
, the two leading software companies used by brands and retailers for online ratings and reviews. The companies merged in 2012 but the antitrust agencies werent notified because the deal was so small. The Justice Department opened an investigation afterward and sued to undo the deal in 2013.
It is not as easy to do a divestiture as I think maybe academics and some judges think, said Himes, who alsohelped monitor Microsofts compliance with the 2001settlement that resolved its antitrust prosecution. They think of this as a clean mechanism for restoring competition. Theoretically it is, but operationalizing it can be more challenging.
Facebook has moved to increase the integration between its main platform and Instagram and WhatsApp, rolling out features this year to let users communicate between Facebook Messenger and the other two services. That could make them even harder to separate.
In the FTCs case against the Illinois hospitals Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corp.'s acquisition of Highland Park Hospital the agency ultimately decided not to unwind the deal because of the difficulties it would entail.Instead, it agreed to a settlement inwhich each hospital would set up a separate team to negotiate contracts. That resolution didnt end up working well and the FTC has never used it again.
In his view, Himes said, a technology company can be more difficult to untangle than a hospital, which has only physical assets and personnel.
The brands are still there, Himes said of Instagram and WhatsApp, but you dont know if the people are still there. That would influence how easy or difficult it is to spin off one of these. In part, the success of the company depends on the people, the strategic thinkers and marketers.
UC Davis Patel said that even if a break-up is possible, that ultimately might not end up being the best way to resolve the cases.
Even if its feasible, a breakup may not be ideal because it may not be a remedy that addresses the competitive harm, Patel said. If the FTC and states show the Instagram and WhatsApp deals were bad because of the impairment to consumer privacy its unclear to me whether the breakup would be the thing that solves the problem.
But Sussman quoted two Supreme Court cases, including a unanimous one from 1990
, that called divestitures or break-ups the preferred remedy for an illegal merger. And in major antitrust suits against monopolies from Standard Oil and American Tobacco in 1911 to the Justice Department case that dissolved the oldAT&amp;T in 1984, breakups were the solution, Sussman said.
All of these dusty, musty cases are going to be pulled out sooner or later, he said.",It’s not a change in parties. It’s a shift in regulators’ attitudes toward deals that help big companies co-opt their competitors.

2020-12-14,How A Real-Life Monopoly Made Monopoly The World's Biggest Board Game,"On New Years Eve, Monopoly celebrates the 85th anniversary of its patent. 
Its publisher, Hasbro, can toast the occasion knowing that its prized board game is more popular than ever. 
In 2013, Euromonitor pegged Monopolys annual revenues at ~$400m. By one estimate, that accounts for ~30% of all mass-market board game sales in the world equivalent to Googles share of the US ad market.
The pandemic has created another boom: Gaming sales for Hasbro reached a record high in Q3 of 2020. In the UK this spring, board game and jigsaw puzzle revenues were up 240% and Monopoly was the top seller. 
Ask industry observers and fans why Monopoly has thrived, and they point to the games unique storyline, nostalgia, and a desire to escape screens.
But theres another factor at play: Hasbro created a real-life monopoly that allowed Monopoly to flourish.
How did Hasbro corner the board game market? And could a new wave of collaborative board games threaten to disrupt their dominance?
From family business to consolidation 
Board games as we know them came into existence around the middle of the 19th century. Many were inspired by religion and designed to imbue children with values of honesty, gratitude, and fair play. 
In the wake of the Civil War, industrialization, and Christianitys embrace of the prosperity gospel, the overriding theme of board games shifted from morality to unbridled capitalism.
And no game captured the spirit of Carnegie and Rockefeller like Monopoly.
The Landlords Game the precursor to todays Monopoly (LandlordsGame.Info)
Monopoly began its life as The Landlords Game.
As Mary Pilon writes in the book The Monopolists, the game was patented in 1904 (and again in 1924) by Lizzie Magie, who originally intended to illustrate the injustices that can arise from the mass accumulation of wealth by one person. 
The Landlords Game, which Magie self-published, became a cult classic. And eventually, it drew the attention of a man named Charles Darrow.
Darrow distributed his own version of the game called Monopoly and, despite not being the original creator, licensed it to a large-scale family business called Parker Brothers. 
In November of 1935, Parker Brothers bought the invention patent for The Landlords Game from Magie for $500, then credited Darrow as Monopolys sole inventor in ads for the game.
Magie felt she had been hoodwinked and told her story to the press.
But there was no going back: Parker Brothers would soon use its Monopoly patent to stifle competitors.
Images from Parker Brothers 1935 patent (Google Patents)
Monopoly violated the cardinal tenets of board game design: The rules were confusing and a single game took an eternity to finish.
Players didnt seem to mind: In 1936, Parker Brothers sold 1.8m copies at $2 each (~$37 in 2020 dollars). And for the next 30 years, the company averaged ~1m copies in annual sales.
Before Monopoly came along, Parker Brothers had flirted with bankruptcy. This influx of sales single-handedly kept the company in competition with rivals like Milton Bradley and Transogram. 
Having a hit in the board game or toy industry is so rare and having one multigenerational game was pretty much unheard of, Pilon tells The Hustle. Monopoly proved board games could be very lucrative. It really upped the stakes.
But a toy company called Hasbro best known for making Mr. Potato Head would end up on top.
Founded by the Hassenfeld brothers in 1923, Hasbro became a player in board games in the early 1980s when it acquired Milton Bradley. The company went on to buy other board game companies like Avalon Hill, Wizards of the Coast, and Coleco. 
In 1991, it wrangled Parker Brothers away from Tonka.
Though the acquisition raised antitrust concerns, the FTC never took action. And just like that, a once wide-open industry was largely closed to competition.
The Hustle
Philip Orbanes, who worked for Parker Brothers and Hasbro and has written multiple books about Monopoly, estimates that by the late 90s Hasbro had cornered 85% of the board game market.
Twister? That belonged to Hasbro. The Game of Life? Hasbro. Battleship, Candyland, Scrabble, Risk, Clue, Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Ouija all Hasbro.
There was an easy word to describe the newfound dominance: It was a monopoly.
From new games to brand extensions
Having vanquished the competition, Hasbro acted like the industry behemoth it was:
<ul><li>It engaged in price fixing with distributors: In 2002, the company was issued a then-record £4.9m (~$8m) fine by Britains Office of Fair Trading.</li><li>It slashed jobs: Despite Hasbros expansion, employment declined from 13k in 1995 to 10k in 1998, according to the companys annual disclosures. (The company now has 5.8k employees.)</li></ul>But most notably, it stopped developing new games.
Rob Daviau, who worked at Hasbro from 1998 to 2012 and is now an independent designer, recalls new titles becoming rarer and rarer as Hasbro prioritized an ethos that had served its toy business well: building on existing brands.  
It was an easy calculation. Extending a brand was far less costly than developing a new game. And Monopoly, Daviau says, was the flagship brand. 
From 1995 to 2005, some 230 official affinity versions of Monopoly were produced. In 1997, Hasbro made a Star Wars Monopoly under license from LucasArts, a formula it went on to replicate with Marvel, Disney, and other entertainment companies.
It felt like utility stocks, Daviau says. They were going to go out and make money, and they werent incredibly difficult to make as a designer It was a good way to make sure the brand was making the numbers.
Weird versions of Monopoly include Elf, Goonies, Metallica, and Bob Ross themed boards; other honorable mentions: Alaska Iditarod Monopoly, Pedigree Dog Lovers Monopoly, Monopoly Socialism, and Berkshire Hathaway Monopoly (Hasbro)
As recently as 2011, industry analysts warned that Hasbros emphasis on reinventing classics rather than creating new games was doomed to fail.
But largely thanks to Monopoly, the company has experienced double-digit growth in board game revenue. In Q4 of 2018, a down year at Hasbro, 2 games Monopoly and Magic: The Gathering net ~$212m in sales alone; all other games totaled ~$267m.
We used to boast at Parker Brothers we had sold 80m Monopoly games around 1990, Orbanes says. The number today is probably approaching or over 300m.   
Monopolys new climb in popularity has coincided with an emphasis on cultivating IP in nearly every entertainment sector. The sequels and spinoffs that involve less risk and less cost are attractive to consumers, who want to repeatedly experience the same entertainment properties.
The average shopper may also have trouble realizing that anything besides classic board games are available:
<ul><li>Hasbro Gamings website features 240 board games, the vast majority of which were invented decades ago; 45 of the games are variations of Monopoly.</li><li>Amazons Monopoly Games &amp; Accessories category returns 676+ results, from the classic version to titles you would never believe exist, like Monopoly Socialism.</li></ul>Under Parker Brothers, Orbanes says, executives feared saturating its prized possession. These days you can play infinite versions of the Monopoly board game, the computer game, and the iPhone game (which is so popular it has more App Store reviews than Tinder).
Zachary Crockett / The Hustle
Hasbro has so far proved there is no limit for brand extension.
If not for that attitude, that confidence, that expertise, and that investment in expansion, Monopoly would be in terms of overall sales probably a fraction of what it is, Orbanes says. Thats where Hasbro clout has made a difference.        
A newcomer: The rise of Asmodee and hobby games
While Hasbro nurtured Monopoly and other classics, independent German publishers started to produce board games with more complex strategies and sleeker designs games that were about cooperation as much as competition.
One of these games, Settlers of Catan (now known as Catan), turned into a breakaway hit. Between 1995 and 2010, it sold ~15m copies globally.
Ticket to Ride, released in 2004, became another phenomenon and showed Catan wasnt a fluke. Trend pieces abounded about the rise of a new style of game that would replace Monopoly and similar pop-strategy games, which have been derided as Ameritrash.       
Hasbro took a pass on games like this and that opened the door for smaller companies like Mayfair Games, Days of Wonder, and Plaid Hat.
These companies comprised the hobby section of the board game market, and its heavy fragmentation resembled the pre-consolidation days of the mass market. 
Then, along came a French company called Asmodee.
Or, as some board game fanatics like to call it, the Borg because it is taking over by assimilation. 
Zachary Crockett / The Hustle
Launched in the 1990s, Asmodee was an afterthought until 2014 when the private equity firm Eurazeo purchased a majority stake in the company and began to rapidly expand.
Asmodee went on a buying spree reminiscent of late 20th century Hasbro.
From 2014 to 2018, it made 20 acquisitions, purchasing Mayfair Games, Fantasy Flight Games, Days of Wonder, and N2Z. The biggest hobby market titles, from Catan to Ticket to Ride to Arkham, now belong to Asmodee. 
The companys revenues leaped from 125m in 2014 to 442m in 2017 almost half of Hasbros 2017 gaming haul. And Eurazeo cleaned up: It purchased Asmodee for 143m and sold it in 2018 to another private equity firm, PAI Partners, for 1.2B. 
After the sale, PAI announced its plan for Asmodee: further expansion through acquisition. 
The year 2020 has seen Asmodee make its fair share of monopoly moves.
In March, it hiked the MSRP of many of its signature games by $5 to $10. It also announced it was launching its own US distribution unit. 
The company had already bought numerous European distributors, to the extent that Stephen Conway, president of a board game nonprofit called The Spiel Foundation and a longtime industry observer, says Asmodee effectively controls European board game distribution.

Some believe the company will elevate hobby games to greater mainstream status and bring more consistency to the market.
Others foresee Asmodee focusing too heavily on its most popular games like Habsro with Monopoly while blocking the path to mainstream success for new titles. 
Either way, attaining Hasbro levels of power appears to be the goal.
End of the Monopoly?
When you own the equivalent of Boardwalk and Park Place and somehow a challenger whose best piece just a few years ago was Baltic Avenue cuts into your lead, how do you react?
Hasbro representatives did not respond to The Hustles request for an interview. But given the history of the industry and the convergence of mass market and hobby games, insiders have hypothesized that one player will try to take over the entire board.
According to Conway, As the larger investment firms become involved (with Asmodee), you could see them saying, Why not set our sights on somebody like Hasbro?
Then again Hasbro might look at the up-and-comer and flip the script on them and say, Lets buy out the competition.   
Some of Hasbros recent actions indicate it may be taking the hobby game market and Asmodee more seriously. In September, it moved Avalon Hill, a subsidiary and producer of niche games, to direct supervision by Hasbros gaming unit.

Unlike board game-focused Asmodee, Hasbro has also invested in growth beyond toys and games.
It bought Entertainment One, which made Hasbro the parent of DreamWorks, Amblin Entertainment, and, among other things, Death Row Records (there is no word on whether a Suge Knight Monopoly game piece is forthcoming). 
In 2017, Hasbro flirted with a purchase of the movie studio Lionsgate, and last year announced, with Lionsgate, the production of a Monopoly movie. Kevin Hart is slated to star. 
So just as Asmodee games capture unprecedented attention, Hasbro is making its prized asset even more ubiquitous.
Its never easy to take down a monopoly, much less one that owns Monopoly.","Monopoly now accounts for nearly one-third of all global board game sales, largely thanks to Hasbro's own expansion strategy."
2021-01-12,Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall,"Markets ended 2020 on a high note, and have started 2021 on a bullish trajectory. All three major indexes have recently surged to all-time highs as investors seemingly looked beyond the pandemic and hoped for signs of a rapid recovery. Veteran strategist Edward Yardeni sees the economic recovery bringing its own slowdown with it. As the COVID vaccination program allows for further economic opening, with more people getting back to work, Yardeni predicts a wave of pent-up demand, increasing wages, and rising prices in short, a recipe for inflation. In the second half of the year we may be on the lookout for some consumer price inflation which would not be good for overvalued assets, Yardeni noted.The warning sign to look for is higher yields in the Treasury bond market. If the Fed eases up on the low-rate policy, Yardeni sees Treasuries reflecting the change first.A situation like this is tailor-made for defensive stock plays and that will naturally bring investors to look at high-yield dividend stocks. Opening up the TipRanks database, weve found three stocks featuring a hat trick of positive signs: A Strong Buy rating, dividend yields starting at 9% or better and a recent analyst review pointing toward double-digit upside.CTO Realty Growth (CTO)We'll start with CTO Realty Growth, a Florida-based real estate company that, last year, made an exciting decision for dividend investors: the company announced that it would change its tax status to that of a real estate investment trust (REIT) for the tax year ending December 31, 2020. REITs have long been known for their high dividend yields, a product of tax code requirements that these companies return a high percentage of their profits directly to shareholders. Dividends are usual route of that return.For background, CTO holds a varied portfolio of real estate investments. The holdings include 27 income properties in 11 states, totaling more than 2.4 million square feet, along with 18 leasable billboards in Florida. The income properties are mainly shopping centers and retail outlets. During the third quarter, the most recent reported, CTO sold off some 3,300 acres of undeveloped land for $46 million, acquired two income properties for $47.9 million, and collected ~93% of contractual base rents due. The company also authorized a one-time special distribution, in connection with its shift to REIT status; its purpose was to put the company in compliance with income return regulation during tax year 2020. The one-time distribution was made in cash and stock, and totaled $11.83 per share.The regular dividend paid in Q3 was 40 cents per common share. That was increased in Q4 to $1, a jump of 150%; again, this was done to put the company in compliance with REIT-status requirements. At the current dividend rate, the yield is 9.5%, far higher than the average among financial sector peer companies.Analyst Craig Kucera, of B. Riley, believes that CTO has plenty of options going forward to expand its portfolio through acquisition: CTO hit the high end of anticipated disposition guidance at $33M in 4Q20, bringing YTD dispositions to nearly $85M, with the largest disposition affiliated with the exercise of a tenant's option to purchase a building from CTO in Aspen, CO. Post these dispositions, we estimate &gt;$30M in cash and restricted cash for additional acquisitions, and we expect CTO to be active again in 1H21.To this end, Kucera rates CTO a Buy along with a $67 price target. At current levels, his target implies a 60% one-year upside potential. (To watch Kuceras track record, click here)Overall, CTO has 3 reviews on record from Wall Streets analysts, and they all agree that this stock is a Buy, making the analyst consensus of Strong Buy unanimous. The shares are priced at $41.85, and their average price target of $59.33 suggests room for ~42% growth in the year ahead. (See CTO stock analysis on TipRanks)Holly Energy Partners (HEP)The energy sector, with its high cash flows, is also known for its high-paying dividend stocks. Holly Energy Partners is a midstream transportation player in sector, providing pipeline, terminal, and storage services for producers of crude oil and petroleum distillate products. Holly bases most of its operations in the Colorado-Utah and New Mexico-Texas-Oklahoma regions. In 2019, the last full year for which numbers are available, the company saw $533 million in total revenues.The companys revenues in 2020 slipped in the first and second quarters, but rebounded in Q3, coming in at $127.7 million. Holly reported at distributable cash flow from which dividends are paid of $76.9 million, up more than $8 million year-over-year. This supported a 35-cent dividend payment per regular share, or $1.40 annualized. At that rate, the dividend yields a strong 10%.Noting the dividend, Well Fargo analyst Michael Blum wrote, Our model suggests the distribution is sustainable at this level as [lost revenue] is offset by inflation escalators in HEP's pipeline contracts and contributions from the Cushing Connect JV project. About 80% of HEP's distribution is tax-deferred.Blum gives HEP a $20 price target and an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating. His target implies a 38% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Blums track record, click here)""Our rating primarily reflects the partnership's steady, fee-based cash flows, robust yield and conservative balance sheet, Blum added.For the most part, Wall Street agrees with Blums assessment on HEP, as shown by the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. That rating is supported by 6 reviews, split 5 to 1 Buys versus Hold. The average price target, at $18.67, suggests that the stock has room to grow ~29% this year. (See HEP stock analysis on TipRanks)DHT Holdings (DHT)Midstreaming is only one part of the global oil industrys transport network. Tankers are another, moving crude oil, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas around the world, in bulk. Bermuda-based DHT operates a fleet of 27 crude oil tankers, all rated VLCC (very large crude carrier). These vessels are 100% owned by the company, and range in tonnage from 298K to 320K. VLCCs are the workhorses of the global oil tanker network.After four quarters of sequential revenue gains, even through the corona half of 1H20, DHT posted a sequential drop in revenues from 2Q20 to 3Q20. The top line that quarter fell from $245 million to $142 million. Its important to note, however, that the 3Q revenue result was still up 36.5% year-over-year. EPS, at 32 cents, was a dramatic yoy turnaround from the 6-cent loss posted in 3Q19.DHT has a history of adjusting its dividend, when needed, to keep it in line with earnings. The company did that in Q3, and the 20-cent per regular share payment was the first dividend cut in 5 quarters. The general policy is a positive for dividend investors, however, as the company has not missed a dividend payment in 43 consecutive quarters an admirable record. At 80 cents per share annualized, the dividend yields an impressive 14%.Kepler analyst Petter Haugen covers DHT, and he sees potential for increased returns in the companys contract schedule. Haugen noted, With 8 out of 16 vessels ending their TC contracts by end Q1 2021, we believe DHT is well positioned for when we expect freight rates to appreciate in H2 2021E.Getting into more details, Haugen adds, [The] main underlying drivers are still intact: fleet growth will be low (1% on average over 2020- 23E) and the US will still end up being a net seaborne exporter of crude oil, making further export growth from the US drive tanker demand. We expect spot rates to improve again during 2021E, shortly after oil demand has normalised. We expect average VLCC rates of USD41,000/day in 2022E and USD55,000/day in 2023E.In line with his comments, Haugen rates DHT a Buy. His $7.40 target price suggests that this stock can grow 34% in the months ahead. (To watch Haugens track record, click here)The rest of the Street is getting onboard. 3 Buys and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. In addition, the $6.13 average price target puts the potential upside at ~11%.

At the time..."
2021-01-12,Visa abandons takeover of Plaid after DOJ raises antitrust concerns,"Visa has ended its takeover efforts of Silicon Valley start-up Plaid about two months after the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit on grounds that it would limit competition in the payments industry.
The company said the decision to end the merger was mutual.
About a year ago, on Jan. 13, 2020, Visa announced that it planned on acquiring Plaid in a deal worth $5.3 billion roughly double the start-up's last private valuation. The company's API software, often referred to as the ""plumbing"" behind fintech companies, lets start-ups connect to users' bank accounts. The company says it integrates with more than 11,000 banks.
Plaid CEO Zach Perret said in a statement the company will work with Visa as an investor and partner going forward.
The deal hit a snag late last year after the DOJ pointed out Visa's acquisition could eliminate a nascent competitive threat. The DOJ cited Visa CEO Al Kelly's description of the deal as an ""insurance policy"" to neutralize a ""threat to our important US debit business.""
The department argued at the time there was potential for the deal to extend a Visa ""monopoly"" on debit transactions, adding that it ""must be stopped.""
The DOJ said in a statement Tuesday that termination of the merger was ""a victory for American consumers and small businesses.""
The lawsuit symbolized a step that many tech critics say should have been taken by the Federal Trade Commission back when it was approving Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.
Now, those mergers are re-entering public discussion. Late last year, the FTC and several states filed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook, alleging it used its market power to squash competitors before they could become true rivals to Facebook's empire. The suits suggest remedies that could include requiring Facebook to spin off those two businesses.

2020-12-30,Nine Payment And Fintech Predictions For 2021,"At the beginning of the year, I spelled out three key payments investment themes for 2020. This was prior to the rise of the global pandemic that saw most of the year obliterated for many. However, the unexpected viral pandemic only accelerated the rate at which alternative payments have been thrust into the spotlight. 
At the end of the unprecedented and unexpected year that was 2021, my predictions for whats to come have tripled. Below are nine trends I expect to hear a lot more about during the next year or so.

Payments go remote
Just as people work from home, the pandemic has given rise to remote shopping and payments. Once a business and their customers have grasped the convenience and speed of sending and receiving money and taking orders remotely, we will see a continued growth of app based money exchange. This will occur both between people and from customers to businesses. Think of Starbucks 
 SBUX
 - once you get used to placing your favorite order with a tap in the app and getting it in a pandemic friendly way, skipping the queue, you will not enjoy going back to waiting in line handing over dirty cash. The same will apply in so many other situations as the businesses that can offer you remote and contact free payments and ordering. I would invest in players assisting and enabling remote payments.

SMEs come back into fashion
As a result of the payment and shopping revolution stemming from mobile payments, the SME segment, the mum and dad stores of the world, will likely see a massive boost in popularity. There are many reasons for this dynamic, but local value creation, focus on quality over quantity, keeping your local stores alive and the digitisation of these local businesses with remote ordering and payment options will help drive this. Not everyone wants to go into the shopping mall and the pandemic effect is set to help smaller quality-focused vendors to prosper if they enable their clients to shop, order and pay in a Starbucks like fashion. 
Offices are dead long live the shared work space
With most people who normally work in offices now working from home, the real estate market will see a massive shift as leases will be terminated or left unrenewed. This is not specifically a payment, fintech or banking prediction, but the industry leaders in this category will likely have few reasons to bring their staff back to offices. With home office and digital tools producing higher efficiency than normal office work, we will likely see an increased investment in tools, home office hardware and stay-sane initiatives like gym, yoga and social events being facilitated by employers while office buildings will be repurposed for something else. Quite a few companies are considering converting their offices in co-working spaces and meeting rooms that would give the option, but not the obligation, to employees to work in the office. I would invest in remote work enablement, productivity and HR tools.

Subscribe to a neo bank
No matter what name you give the Revolut, N26, Nubank and Monzos of the world, they will all start to charge some form of subscription or service fee from their customers. The card networks are focusing on account-to-account infrastructure acquisitions to the extent that card issuing bonuses can no longer keep these loss machines afloat. You may not know this but the majority of challenger banks revenue comes from Client Incentive Agreements with the card networks. They get paid to issue as many cards as they can. Thats why every potential new financial services idea ends up revolving around some kind of card concept. But most people have plenty of cards already. 
While there is still some juice left in the venture capital carton for these beauty queens, they have to make some real money soon. The majority of what they sell, retail banks do already and the difference is brand and gift wrapping. Flashy app design and modern corresponding banking to reduce FX costs only takes you so far when you are out of money. I predict that few people will convert to the challenger banks as their primary relationship in 2021. So there will still be a series of funding rounds needed to keep these players alive and for that we will see feature after feature announced, as future revenue opportunities will have to be presented for the risk capital to be applied. Expect Revolut and co to become feature factories making their apps even more cluttered as they chase more investments. Some of the challenger banks will survive but some will not. I would be very selective.
Interest rates go up
As the affluent markets see a rise in housing prices the interest rates will start to move upwards. The world economy is still standing on shaky grounds and we may just as likely see a correction with stock exchange crashes, but interest rates are likely to start growing slowly in 2021.

Crypto gets a jump, then flattens again
With world markets synthetically positive and sane experts giving advice to stay calm as a correction will likely come, money is looking elsewhere for growth. Lately we have seen crypto coming back into fashion as interest rates are so low that both big and small money is put into crypto. With hyped announcements that many big players will now accept crypto as payments or allow their customers to hold crypto, bitcoin and its various siblings are back in fashion. Most people seem to have no clue how they work and it's set to become the same ponzi-scheme we have seen before. In 2021 we will likely see crypto prices rise further above their previous records. But I predict it will fall back down as it did in January each year for the last three years. The bottom of the crypto market will fall out when a sizable and trustworthy government bank from a politically stable country makes a crypto sibling of their fiat currency and pushes it on a public ledger. I predict this will happen in the Nordics or with the Euro, but likely not before 2022.
PSD2 matures while PSD3 is what will drive real competition
As industry giants who serve banks with core systems have come around and made aggregation services, the promised access to bank accounts becomes sort of real in Europe. PSD2 has been plagued with deliberate hurdles for third parties to connect to accounts as the API variations are many and the lack of adherence with the regulatory technical standards (RTS) is mindblowing. The regulators are also sadly way too kind with law breakers. Check if any of the PSD2 APIs you know of have support for strong customer authentication (SCA) exceptions such as trusted beneficiary for example... they dont. 
In 2021 we will see a growth of interconnectivity, with accounts listed and payments conducted from inside your favorite apps. But we will have to wait for PSD3 for universal bank account access to be everyday for the majority of banked people.
The behemoths continue to buy anything that challenges their position
As open banking, account-to-account and mobile payment apps are set to form new payment networks and payment habits for both people and businesses, the payment and banking giants, such as Visa 
 V
, MasterCard 
 MA
, Amex and Union Pay will continue to buy anything that threatens their established money machines. The governments of the world have slowly woken up to the reality of the situation and are now set to break the monopolies up. With Visa being sued by the US justice department for their acquisition of Plaid and Facebook facing the same situation for WhatsApp (that also acts as a payment service) we will likely see a change in how such deals are made. Nevertheless they will continue. It is likely we will see more creep acquisitions and majority investments but not full takeovers. One example is Visa's involvement in Klarna. If you cant beat them, buy a sizable piece and make sure they also push card payments and you will be alright. Card networks now virtually control the real-time and next generation account to account based payment systems around Europe and the U.S. and this will continue in 2021.

The m-commerce enablement space catches fire
With mobile payment apps (like Venmo, Zelle, AliPay, Settle etc) growing rapidly for the reasons explained above and businesses starting to sell in new ways due to the pandemic, the tools and services that enable mobile commerce will see a massive rise in 2021. This growth will span many sectors, such as social media management and digital advertising tools but mostly it will hit the mobile commerce enablement providers. Think simple software tools to make a digital menu for a restaurant, to open up a mobile store that is marketed on Instagram and a simple ordering and delivery system for small stores to do their own Starbucks-like apps. Facebook with their Shop and WhatsApp payments initiatives have already taken a deep dive into this segment. But there are startups, scale-ups and grown-ups that will all attack this massive opportunity as virtually every business needs to go mobile. Players like Glide are a fun example of a tool that will likely grow massively in 2021. It will be a year of fragmentation where Uber 
 UBER
 eats, Deliveroo, Foodora and other such players will see competition from each restaurant's own self-made apps, because they are so easy to make.

2021-01-15,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants to win the war against fintechs, expecting 'tough, brutal' competition in the next 10 years","The decades-long race between big banks and fintechs is coming to a head. No longer scrappy startups, fintechs like Square and Stripe have come of age. As they've grown, banks like JPMorgan have become increasingly wary of the competition.
Citing the massive valuations of fintech standouts like PayPal, Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo asked JPMorgan's CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon how he plans to ""win"" during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call on Friday.
""We've been doing fine in the last 5 years,"" Dimon said, adding that he sent a list of company valuations — including PayPal ($280 billion), Mastercard ($322 billion), Alibaba ($658 billion), Facebook ($715 billion), Google ($1.2 trillion), and Apple ($2.1 trillion) — to the bank's operating committee. The companies have surpassed or are catching up to JPMorgan's roughly $422 billion market cap.
""Absolutely, we should be scared shitless about that,"" Dimon said.
To be sure, Dimon isn't backing down.
""I expect there to be very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years,"" Dimon said. ""I expect to win. So help me, God.""
Even though they're competing, banks and fintechs need each other
Most of the fintechs cited during the call aren't actually banks. They are tech companies that partner with banks, using someone else's bank charter to move money and hold deposits. That means that banks' see fintechs simultaneously as their biggest competition and as valued partners.
""We bank a lot of them. We help them accomplish what they want to accomplish,"" Dimon said. ""My view is we're going to compete where we need to.""
""I think we are now facing a whole generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who, if they don't ride the rails of JP Morgan, they can ride the rails of someone else,"" Dimon said.  
Read more: JPMorgan slashed how long it takes to test out fintechs from 9 months to 3 weeks with a new process that could save it millions as it looks to buy, invest in, or work with more young companies
JPMorgan has invested big to bring fintechs into its fold. But they're not the only ones. Incumbents like Visa and Mastercard, too, are locking in partnerships with fintechs like Brex and SoFi.
And where JPMorgan isn't partnering, it's competing.
""Everyone's going to want to be involved in payments"" Dimon said. ""Fintech competitors white label the banks and build whatever service they want on top of it, and we have to be prepared for that.""
Dimon raised concerns around financial data and called out Plaid
In discussing the complicated relationship between banks and fintechs, Dimon made a point to highlight how fintechs' size in the market impacts competition.
""There are examples of unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually,"" Dimon said. ""People who will make a lot more on debit because they operate under certain things. The only reason they compete is because of that.""
Read more: Execs from Plaid and Yodlee explain how new data-sharing rules will dictate the future of how banks and fintechs work together
One of those ""things"" is the Durbin Amendment, which puts a limit on the debit fees larger banks can charge merchants per transaction. Banks with less than $10 billion in deposits — which is where most fintech challenger banks fall — are exempt from those restrictions.
Dimon also called out fintechs — which aren't subject to the same regulations as JPMorgan — that don't do their own anti-money laundering and due-diligence when onboarding new customers, saying they create risk for the system. Financial data sharing was mentioned, too.
""We will be a little more aggressive on people who improperly use data that's been given to them by Plaid. You can expect that there will be other battles that take place here,"" Dimon said.
Read more: A regulatory turf war is brewing in the red-hot payments space between the OCC and big banks. Insiders explain what's at stake and how it could impact fintechs.
JPMorgan and Plaid have a data-sharing agreement, granting Plaid's fintech customers access to consumer financial data like account and routing numbers.
""Data privacy and security are core to everything we do, including the data exchange agreements we have with JPMorgan Chase among many other banks,"" a Plaid spokesperson told Insider.
Across the industry, tensions around banks' data-sharing practices are high. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently working on new rules for data sharing based on the Dodd-Frank Act — the legislation created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis — which could force banks to agree to industry-wide standards when it comes to what fintechs can access. 
Dimon has been a strong proponent of controlling how customer information is disseminated. In early 2020, Dimon said the bank was working on ways to allow customers to cut off third-party apps access to their data. 
JPMorgan is looking for acquisition ideas, especially in payments
Competition is heating up in the world of payments, especially as consumers start shifting more of their spend toward digital. Less use of cash is a tailwind for all payments players, including JPMorgan.
When asked whether JPMorgan would pursue M&amp;A in a segment like payments, Dimon said that he's open to deals as a way to grow in tandem with organic growth across its payments business. 
""We're quite good at [payments], between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services,"" Dimon said.
""But we're open for inorganic too,"" he added.

Dimon even asked for any acquisition ideas from participants on the call. 
""We're always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently,"" Dimon said. ""We've got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous set of competitors, particularly in payments.""
Dimon mentioned players like Google, which just revamped its Google Pay app to include checking accounts. And PayPal's app, as well as Venmo, are gaining traction among consumers as a go-to digital wallet.
""We like competition. We believe in it,"" Dimon said, ""but we have to be really prepared for that. And that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business.""","Summary List PlacementThe decades-long race between big banks and fintechs is coming to a head.

2021-01-12,Visa and Plaid call off $5.3B merger citing DoJ pushback,"Visa is calling off its marriage with fintech startup Plaid rather than fight the Justice Department’s claims that the tie-up would limit competition in the debit-card market.
The two companies announced after the closing bell on Tuesday that they are terminating their planned $5.3 billion union after coming to the conclusion that it would require prolonged litigation with DoJ, which sued to block the deal in November on antitrust grounds.
We believe the combination of Visa with Plaid would have delivered significant benefits, Visa chief Al Kelly said in a statement. However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.
Visa announced its acquisition in Jan. 2020, but the deal was held up by the DoJ review. 
“While Plaid and Visa would have been a great combination, we have decided to instead work with Visa as an investor and partner so we can fully focus on building the infrastructure to support fintech, Plaid co-founder and CEO Zach Perret said in a statement.
News of the the merger’s death sent Twitter afire with speculation that Plaid could become an acquisition target by a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with some users predicting that so-called SPAC King investor Chamath Palihapitiya will pursue Plaid with his fifth SPAC after using his fourth to do a $8.65 billion deal with fintech darling SoFi.
Since the merger was announced, the market for SPACs has caught fire and some speculated that Plaid, valued at $2.65 billion after its most recent funding round in 2018, would be an ideal target for a SPAC to merge with and take public.

2021-01-02,Mastercard's new chief product officer has big plans for B2B payments and open banking,"Mastercard is best known to consumers as the symbol on their credit and debit cards, and for processing card transactions globally. But it's spent the past few decades working on becoming much more than a card-payment processor. 
To that end, it's just joined its engineering and product teams under the leadership of a new chief product officer, Craig Vosburg. He'll oversee thousands of employees who work on user-focused design, and will be tasked with driving growth in new areas for Mastercard, including non-card payments, open banking initiatives, and Mastercard Labs, the company's R&amp;D arm. 
""If you think about the company from its earliest beginnings more than 50 years ago, we appeared on the scene as effectively a card company that was enabling consumer credit transactions,"" Vosburg told Insider.
But the company has added new use cases, including business and commercial payments. And it's also expanded the payment types it supports to include real-time payments, peer-to-peer, and blockchain-enabled transactions.
On top of these various payments ""rails,"" Mastercard has added things like data-sharing services and fraud monitoring, leveraging the wealth of data it already has from its business and consumer end users.
""We've evolved who we think of as our customer to be not just the bank and their consumer, but merchants, governments, digital players, fintechs, and companies large and small,"" Vosburg said.
It's all a part of Mastercard's strategy to be involved in any and every payment flow, globally, which has meant a full evolution of its bread-and-butter business. Rival processor Visa, too, is vocal about its ambitions beyond cards, looking to become what it calls a ""network of networks.""

Mastercard's goals in combining engineering and product are twofold. One is to get closer to its customers and understand where it should invest in its platform. The second is to help Mastercard meet evolving customer needs more nimbly and more efficiently, Vosburg said. 
""The closer we bring the technology and the product capabilities to the market and to our partners and customers, the more effectively we think we'll be able to serve them with the kinds of speed and adaptability that the market today requires,"" Vosburg said.
Vosburg, formerly head of North America at Mastercard, is CPO effective January. He'll be succeeded by Linda Kirkpatrick, a long-time exec at Mastercard who currently oversees Mastercard's US issuer business.
Vosburg is laser-focused on uniting Mastercard's entire payments stack
In a year where consumers and merchants by necessity moved online, the long-standing trend toward digital payments and cash displacement accelerated. Shifts that experts expected to happen over the next several years have happened in a matter of months. And keeping up with the growth in new digital payments has informed much of Mastercard and other payments players' product strategies. 
""The events of 2020 have served to both validate the path we were on as far as our strategic priorities and accelerate the need for us to execute against that path,"" Vosburg said.
As consumers increasingly pay using more than just cards and cash, players like Mastercard have no choice but to build out their processing capabilities to support things like account-to-account payments and buy now, pay later transactions.
To be sure, many consumer use cases still default to card-based payments, which includes contactless options like digital wallets. But Mastercard sees a big opportunity to use its non-card payment capabilities to grow its business customer base, especially when it comes to companies paying each other quickly and keeping tabs on their accounts.
""A lot of the early opportunities that we're targeting with those capabilities focus on the B2B space, which is one we're particularly excited about,"" Vosburg said. ""Non-card rails, we think, bring a lot of value to B2B payments, particularly accounts payables for corporates.""
For businesses, speed and accuracy of money movement  through automation is crucial to keeping costs low. To that end, Mastercard is building out more tools for businesses in addition to processing payments. 
""These are all things where real-time payments, fast ACH, blockchain, and account-to-account can all play a role,"" Vosburg said. ""That's an area that we're targeting for development of applications to go after those use cases.""
And Vosburg envisions growth in this area over a period of decades.
""It'll be a decades-long journey, as the consumer cards journey has been a decades-long one starting more than 50 years ago,"" Vosburg said.
With its Finicity deal closed, data is now a big focus for Mastercard
As consumers' financial lives are increasingly fragmented across various banks and apps, financial data has become top-of-mind for all players. Fintechs need access to financial data, which is usually stored in banks. Sitting between fintechs and banks are data aggregators like Finicity, Plaid, and Yodlee, which provide the data pipes. 
With the proliferation of digital finance, open banking and open finance have become top-of-mind for all players in the market, Mastercard included. Open banking refers to access to bank data like account numbers and balances. Open finance is broader, including more pieces of consumers' financial lives such as payroll, insurance, credit cards, and investments. 
In November, Mastercard closed its $825 million acquisition Finicity. Visa announced plans to acquire Plaid in January, but the deal has since been halted by the DOJ, which says Visa's deal was an attempt to squash a competitor. 
Read more: We talked to Mastercard's incoming CEO about why the card giant is spending $825 million to buy financial-data startup Finicity and how it compares to the Visa-Plaid deal
""I see open banking as something that is certainly taking on greater importance,"" Vosburg said. 
In Europe, it's largely been regulators driving open banking standards, whereas in the US, data sharing standards are being set more so in the private sector. 
""Interestingly, because I think it's been driven by market dynamics, you see a variation in approaches,"" Vosburg said. ""It's early stage. It's a very competitive and dynamic field.""
Currently, aggregators like Plaid and Yodlee are standing up separate data-sharing agreements with the country's largest banks, and the terms of each agreement vary. Then there's Akoya, a newer aggregator in the space backed by the banks themselves that's looking to offer a single data connection across the banks it signs on to its platform. US Bank was the first to sign on to Akoya's platform in November. 
Industry-wide groups like FDX, for example, are setting technical standards for data management via APIs. The CFPB announced plans to issue rules on data sharing agreements, requesting input from all players in the industry through the beginning of next year. 
Now, with Finicity, Mastercard will have a larger part to play in those discussions.
Read more: Execs from Plaid and Yodlee explain how new data-sharing rules will dictate the future of how banks and fintechs work together
""We see great promise and value for Mastercard in playing a role in that space, in part because it's a space that would benefit from having a trusted intermediary in helping to facilitate flows of data in the right way,"" Vosburg said.
Fintechs also need partnerships with processors like Mastercard if they want to offer card products. And Mastercard has doubled down on its fintech outreach, creating a new team earlier this year to manage the relationships with up-and-coming digital players. In 2020, Mastercard won over fintechs like Brex, Dave, and SoFi, from Visa.","Summary List PlacementMastercard is best known to consumers as the symbol on their credit and debit cards, and for processing card transactions globally.

2020-12-22,Changing the rules to control monopolies could see the end of Facebook domination,"No one raised an eyebrow when Mark Zuckerberg bought tiny Instagram in 2012 for US$1 billion. Now regulators want to unwind the deal, by forcing Facebook to sell Instagram, and WhatsApp. This move may spell the disintegration of the Facebook empire. 

But this is not only about Facebook, or Amazon, Google, and Apple. It is a global shift of the boundaries within which monopolies can function. 

The US Justice Department recently blocked Visa from buying Plaid, which provides payment processes and works in a similar way to Stripe. Plaid provides the plumbing that lets apps like Venmo, a cash transfer service, or Robinhood, a stock trading platform, access user bank accounts. 

Today, Plaid acts as a link between fintech apps and some 11,000 financial institutions. Visa and Mastercard aid in electronic funds transfers between bank accounts but Plaid can take out these middle men. One day, consumers might make purchases without a debit or credit card, paying merchants directly from their bank accounts. That’s why Visa wants Plaid – it can’t afford to miss the next big thing. As the late Intel CEO, Andy Grove said, only the paranoid survive. 

Regulators worry that an acquisition could “deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa”. This change in attitude indicates that companies may no longer be able to simply buy out their competition. Many regulators globally have broadened their field of view, and “consumer welfare” has a wider scope. Regulation seems to indicate that pricing is no longer the only consideration - there has been a shift towards protecting a competitive marketplace.

Cornering the market

Datasets become exponentially more valuable when you combine them. When Google introduced Gmail, it built a new dataset of people’s identities. In addition to the existing search engine dataset, Google then also had people’s email addresses and IPs. As a result, Google’s AdWords can now provide more refined targeting for advertisers.

The same happened with Google Maps. When Google tied people’s identity and purchase intent to their geo-location, advertisements became even more accurate to target consumers.

In today’s economy, this ability to predict behaviour, curate offerings, and fulfil orders automatically, offer the single most important advantage: helping an organisation expand. Sure, the initial entrepreneurial insights are still important - discovering your customer’s needs is the first step. But once you’re past the stage of a minimal viable product, your ability to scale determines your success.

That’s why tech giants are sweeping up the start-up field – buying up other businesses has been an important route for growth. It is also harder for entrepreneurs to stay independent and IPOs have been on the decline. And in the case of Instragram, its co-founders kept fighting against Zuckerberg even after the acquisition. Eventually, they abandoned Instagram and left Facebook altogether. 

What we see now is the blocking of tech giants from buying up small firms. Or, in the case of Facebook, it might unwind its deals executed a decade ago. The logic is to prevent the concentration of industrial power, because too much concentration always leads to systemic risks. 



China leads the charge to stricter regulation

This is what happened in China. Just hours before the launch of Ant Group’s mega IPO, Chinese authorities cited “major issues” with the company. The release of the US$300 billion fintech disruptor IPO has now been put on pause.

At the heart of Ant Group is a product called Alipay, created by Alibaba in 2004 as a payment tool for its online marketplaces. It then went into financial services, such as lending, wealth management, and insurance, all of which were offered through Alipay. Like all things in China, Ant Group’s growth has been epic. China now aims to limit it’s size and reach, and that is what regulators are navigating across the globe.

When it comes to Amazon, no one is saying that the company is monopolising retail or that it is charging prices that are too high and hurting consumers; its revenue is still smaller than Walmart’s. But regulators are saying Amazon’s own rules allow it to use data from its third parties to have an unfair advantage over its competition.

Similarly, Facebook also fears competition. In one example it reportedly slowed down Snapchat’s growth by copying and using features created by Snapchat. Vanity Fair called it a “campaign to destroy Snapchat”. 

The ease and speed with which large companies can use such tactics reveals the extent to which the playing field is not level.

Where do we go from here?

In each of these examples, it’s not only the market share won by the tech giants that’s causing concern. It’s also the ease at which a company can cut across all verticals and use its data advantage to overwhelm competition. What might emerge from this is that tech giants may simply be barred from entering certain sectors entirely, such as healthcare, finance, transport, and more.

It wouldn’t be the first time. The reason AT&T didn’t participate in the computer business was not for a lack of technology - it had been prohibited from doing so in a 1956 agreement after the company was deemed a “natural monopoly.” Until it was broken up in 1984, AT&T had been barred from entering the computer business.

What could come out of banning large companies from entire sectors? You protect and make space for progression and development. Regulators can help to create a level playing, giving new players a chance, and stopping larger companies becoming such enormous monopolies that their self-preservation hinders progression – which benefits us all.

2020-12-16,Dynamhex Launches An Energy Data API Platform To Accelerate Climate Action,"In recent months, several major cities have taken steps to announce climate-friendly measures as part of their recovery from the Covid-19 economic downturn. The initiative led by the C40 Global Mayors Covid-19 Recovery Task Force aims to create a plan that allows for the implementation of a strong economic recovery based on the principles of a Global Green New Deal. As part of the plan, C40 members have reaffirmed their commitment to cutting emissions from the sectors most responsible for climate change and keeping temperatures below the 1.5°C goals of the Paris Agreement. But for cities to implement the aims of the Global Green New Deal, they would need to cut global emissions in half by 2030 and replace polluting fossil fuel in the power, transportation and building sectors with clean alternatives. To execute these goals, cities and relevant stakeholders, such as residents and their local utilities, businesses and corporations, all require greater visibility into energy data to understand the source of carbon emissions from the sectors operating in their communities. Only with this level of understanding and granularity can decision-makers develop feasible climate action plans that are in line with national and international standards. 
In the energy sector, the accessibility of open energy models and data has often lagged behind other fields. Research led by the Climate Policy Group at ETH Zürich found that a significant share of energy data is owned by private entities where the need to protect intellectual property limits visibility for stakeholders. To move forward and accelerate climate action, the public and private sectors need to collaborate on essential emissions data to drive forward effective science-based policies and help investors make more informed decisions when assessing climate-related risks. 
One company looking to solve the critical need to access energy data is Dynamhex. For the past two years, Dynamhex has been developing an integrated API platform, akin to Plaid meets Palantir, for energy that aims to develop a ready-to-go approach to building greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory data. By gathering large sets of GHG data and bringing multiple stakeholders together, Dynamhex seeks to create a cleantech marketplace that connects governments, residents and businesses with cleantech vendors through a common application to accelerate measurable action on climate change. 
Using artificial intelligence and partnerships to accelerate energy data acquisition
Dynamhex is building a national GHG inventory through a two-step approach. Firstly, it is using econometric and geospatial datasets from multiple sources to run artificial intelligence models that develop a bottom-up GHG framework inventory without needing to ingest consumer-permissioned data points. Secondly, Dynamhex is increasing inventory accuracy by partnering with utilities and public/private entities. As part of the data-sharing agreement to use Dynamhex's platform, these partners provide their energy data via a secure and standard API, which allows decision-makers to collaborate around a set of standardised data points and develop long-term climate action plans. In a recent article, Open Data Charter and World Resources Institute jointly highlighted the importance of high-quality data for driving effective climate policies and the need for national stakeholders to access relevant and usable data sources for inclusive and transparent decisions. For these reasons, by creating this centralised emissions data platform, Dynamhex aims to support engagement among stakeholders, such as energy providers, consumers, regulators and funders, and build the public's trust and awareness around climate change. 
For Dynamhex's CEO, Dr Sunny Sanwar, the potential to unlock and foster a greater level of transparency around energy data has been the driving motivation behind Dynamhexs energy data API platform. Dr Sanwar stated in an interview that having ""transparent energy data is critical to accelerating collaboration between the city and private/civic actors as a way to set and implement climate change targets"". He added that by leveraging Dynamhex, ""cities, utilities and private entities can understand each other's carbon footprint and collaborate through Dynamhex's climate-tech marketplace to develop, deploy and manage low-carbon projects in their community"". In connecting every stakeholder involved, Dr Sanwar hopes to not only reduce the coordination costs of climate change mitigation but also, more importantly, to 'see' all the invisible carbon emissions in every community and neighbourhood in the U.S. and beyond. By enabling greater insights into carbon emissions, Dr Sanwar aims to create a growing database of clean energy companies in each locality that develops localised, cost-effective clean energy solutions to thwart the effects of climate change. 
Improving programmes and enabling customers to develop insights from energy data
Dynamhex has formed partnerships with various municipal governments and large utilities to support regional planning, programme evaluations and climate change initiatives. In 2020, Prairie Village City, Kansas awarded Dynamhex a one-year, $12,000 contract to track and evaluate the city's greenhouse gas emissions and create an action plan for city officials and residents. Meanwhile, in Roeland Park, Kansas, the local mayor and city council adopted similar measures to use Dynamhex as the main insights platform to measure and track the city's greenhouse gas emissions year on year. According to Dr Sanwar, the city's leaders have been using Dynamhex to ""examine which projects on city-owned facilities should be part of the near-term climate investments to meet 2025's emissions targets"". He stated that ""based on Dynamhex's assessment and recommendations, the power utilities have become involved and have used Dynamhex's platform to showcase the GHG impact of on-site and ground-mount solar PV projects to propose an install-own-operate energy project"" (in the Kansas area). 
Aside from Dynamhex's partnerships with municipal governments, Dr Sanwar's team has also been collaborating with large utilities in the United States. He pointed out that ""ExelonEXC
 and Duke EnergyDUK
 have been using Dynamhex to evaluate their energy programmes across service territories and showcasing the climate and cost savings impact from these programmes to their customers."" According to Dr Sanwar, utilities are excited about Dynamhex's platform because it enables them to ""aggregate and analyse information from metre-level profiles within a geographic region to help predict demand so different demand response programmes can be designed and deployed"". These insights capabilities allow power producers to understand their customers' energy usage and develop customised programmes for specific customers or designated areas with unexpectedly high energy bills, higher emissions profiles or even at-risk communities. 
Building a cleantech marketplace to help deploy zero-emission products 
Low carbon reduction planning through Dynamhex's platform
Dynamhex
A significant value that Dynamhex offers is the ability to bring together every party involved in a low-carbon transaction and allow them to interact and exchange through a climate-tech marketplace in the form of buyers (enterprise, building owners, cities) and sellers (utilities, low-carbon service providers, investors). For example, through Dynamhex's marketplace, cities can follow up on their emissions targets by creating projects, such as reducing GHG emissions in buildings. Based on the city's energy data on Dynamhex's platform, utilities can develop programmes for building owners and, upon reviewing their energy profiles, recommend ways to electrify fuel usage or reduce power usage in line with the city's climate change target. Building owners can then adjust their power usage by adopting the utility's energy programmes, and they can purchase energy-efficient products, offered by low-carbon service providers on Dynamhex's marketplace, to reduce their energy consumption. As more building owners look to buy energy-efficient products through Dynamhex's marketplace, low-carbon service providers can acquire customers more efficiently and deploy products at scale. For the municipal government, Dynamhex's marketplace allows officials to access the impact of their climate and energy policies and manage emissions-reducing projects by seeing how well utilities, building owners and low-carbon service providers are interacting with each other. Based on interim results, the municipal government can easily reformulate its policy measures to address gaps and keep annual climate targets on track. 
According to Dr Sanwar, Dynamhex's marketplace ""not only allows buyers and sellers to interact but also enables them to understand the cost-savings from emissions reductions by leveraging the GHG inventory data on the platform"". As corporations and governments look to set goals for 2030 and 2050, there will be a greater need to align on collective goals and improve market transparency, which will be critical in meeting GHG targets. For Dr Sanwar, Dynamhex's data layer and software platform reduces the coordination inefficiencies between stakeholders, allowing them to focus on implementing their climate goals through trackable energy projects. Finally, to facilitate broader decarbonisation efforts, climate-tech solution providers will need to be able to integrate and deploy their solutions within existing industries. Dr Sanwar highlighted that Dynamhex's energy data API and AI-enabled marketplace would allow these providers to access market insights, enabling them to build customised products for their customers and scale their business. As the need to address climate change becomes more urgent, Dynamhex's platform could go a long way in making necessary data available to effectively tackle climate action plans and subsequently meet climate goals.","A new ready-to-go approach is building GHG inventory data and creating a cleantech marketplace that connects governments, residents and businesses with cleantech vendors to accelerate measurable action on climate change"
2020-12-07,"Visa: Very Expensive, But Wait","There are only a few sectors that seem unfazed by COVID-19 and the resultant economic slowdown, and understandably, their stocks have breached historical highs in 2020. Contrary to that tenet, Visa Inc.'s (V) business is bearing the impact of constrained travel globally, and changed consumer spending patterns, but its stock has raced up by 55% since the selloff in March 2020, reaching, and continuing to hover around, a new five-year high. The pressures of 2020 notwithstanding, V is an excellent stock to own for long, but the stock has rallied too far ahead for there to be great value for investors buying now.
V's results for its FY ending September 2020 have been less than glowing. The company's revenue declined by ~5% YOY, its EPS declined by ~8% YOY. The company attributed the decline mainly to the fall in revenues from international transactions (down over 19% YoY), resulting from the reduced global travel and consequent decline in cross-border transaction volumes (down 16% YoY). Even as some countries began to open in H2 2020, the period of stress for V is far from over, evidenced by decline of about 29% YOY in cross-border transaction volumes in its Q4 FY20. Revenue from international transactions accounted for 29% (see table below), and stress on the segment will continue to impact V's topline in the near future.

</table>It is a telling point that in H1 FY20 (October 2019-March 2020, before the impact of COVID was fully felt in financials), V's net revenues increased 10% YOY. The pressure on revenue that manifested from H2 onwards is certainly a short-term phenomenon, an outcome of the global pandemic; and the company's fundamentals are robust enough to absorb the decline without impacting long-term business prospects. Even after the decline in FY20, V's profitability is exceptional with 65% operating and 50% net margins, and its balance sheet is robust, with an annual free cash flow of $9.7 billion in FY20 and a low debt/equity of ~0.7.
The other aspects of its business, like its strong volume growth in debit card volumes, its expanding access points globally (16% growth in FY20, taking V to ~70 million merchant locations), increasing contactless penetration and virtual cards, expanded partnerships globally and healthy renewals of existing clients, and robust growth in its value-added services (VAS, 18% growth in FY20), all are favorable aspects for the long-term business outlook of the company. There is also the potential for raising its swipe fees in the US, which should also provide an upward fillip to revenue. V's acquisitions, most recently of Latin America focused software platform YellowPepper, also seem focused on diversifying its revenue mix, by becoming a 'network of networks', allowing V to better market its VAS and traditional services in different markets.
While there is expected to be some margin pressure in FY21, the company has achieved cost savings even in FY20, and expects the capex in FY21 will remain around $700 million (FY19: $736 million), which should ensure that the robustness of V's financial health will remain unchallenged.
Then there is also the company's history of dividend payouts and stock buybacks, which makes it a tremendous stock to own. The company has indicated plans to continue using its free cash flow for the purpose in FY21; it bought back shares worth ~$8 billion in FY20, and the guidance that the practice will continue even in a difficult year, reflects well on the company's earnings quality.
The stock was an obvious buy when it slid sharply in the early days of COVID, when it fell by ~28% in the period Jan-March 2020. But the stock rebounded since then, barely 3% away from the five-year high of ~$216 it touched in September. Even the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filing to block V's $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, citing monopolistic practice, has not affected the momentum, with the price only increasing 7% since the DOJ filing on 5 November. With a TTM P/E of 43 times, V seems too expensive to buy now.
Some of the exuberance surrounding the stock seems to be centered around the availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, and the subsequent increase in consumer sentiment and spending. However, unlike UPS, where there is an expected long-term shift in consumer behavior and B2C distribution channels, optimism for V's stock seems heavily dependent on what must necessarily be seen as a non-recurring phenomenon: consumer spending went down because of the pandemic and it is now beginning to recover. There is nothing to say that the spending levels will reach newer heights on the other side of the vaccine, and that must be considered when looking at buying V.
It is likely that the stock will see a correction when the enthusiasm over increased consumer spending will normalize, and the market factors in that the strong growth expectation is buoyed in part by the low base of 2020. The company's own expectation, shared in October, for GDP recovery in the US is about 4.4% in 2021, which will moderate to ~2.9% in the following year. While the actual recovery rate will be subject to many variables, including the successful adoption of the COVID vaccine, recovery from the economic slump, both in US and globally, is unlikely to be the unwavering upward trajectory that the stock market seems to expect, as evidenced in V's price rally.
Apart from the timing, it is absolutely incorrect to suggest that V is not a stock to be bought or held. It is a great stock to keep if one already holds it. It is just not the best time to buy now, given how expensive it is, and there should be better points of entry when the stock market catches up with the realities of recovery.

2021-01-14,Fintech startup Plaid has a slew of investors who won't get paydays now that Visa's $5.3 billion deal is off. And they say they're happy about it.,"Things have not gone according to plan for fintech startup Plaid. But its investors now say that may be for the best.
In January, Visa agreed to purchase the fintech unicorn for $5.3 billion, giving Plaid's backers a sweet return on their investment — roughly seven years after the company raised its first round of venture capital.
But the deal fell apart on Tuesday, after regulators refused to approve it and instead sued to stop it, saying it was anti-competitive. In the face of that, both parties agreed to walk, they said in a statement.
That's the official story. But people familiar with the situation are saying that Plaid had ""buyer's remorse,"" because the company believes it's worth much more now, and used the lawsuit as an excuse to scuttle the sale, according to Axios.
Read more:Plaid pulled the plug on the Visa deal over price, not antitrust concerns
Plaid's cofounder and CEO Zach Perret now says he's in no rush to find a new buyer and is instead focused on growing the business. Still, there's plenty of speculation that a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, will come calling.
In any case, Plaid's current slate of investors will have to wait before they can cash out their shares. And there's plenty of them. Plaid raised $309 million in four rounds from about two dozen investors and had an estimated valuation of around $2.65 billion before the Visa deal, according to deals database PitchBook.
Plaid's software pipes data between consumer finance apps and banks. The acquisition would have been a critical move for Visa, one of the world's largest payments platforms already, to own that pipe as well.
The price tag on its potential sale to Visa would have made it one of the largest deals in fintech history, which invited a higher level of scrutiny from the Department of Justice. The department sued in November to stop the acquisition alleging that it was anticompetitive, after learning that Plaid was building a tool intended to directly challenge Visa. 
""Continuing to pursue the transaction with Visa would have meant that we continued to litigate with the DOJ. And that process could have taken, minimally, many many months. More likely, more than a year,"" Perret told Insider.
Investors tell us they're happy 
Plaid may have reason to celebrate staying independent. Early investors say they're convinced that the company will have an even better outcome as the pandemic accelerates adoption of its tools and other fintech services.
In 2020, Plaid said it saw a 60% increase in customer growth and has added ""hundreds"" of banks to its customer base.
""The world has changed a lot in the past year, and has created even bigger opportunities for Plaid to help consumers interact with the financial system with ease,"" said David Tisch, a cofounder of BoxGroup, an early Plaid investor.
 Some of its venture capitalists think Plaid is well positioned to maintain that growth in 2021 and beyond, they say.
Read more:Plaid's CEO says the fintech isn't looking for new exit opportunities after its $5.3 billion Visa deal imploded
""The upside from here is massive,"" said Tisch, who invested in Plaid at the seed stage in 2013.
Hunter Walk, a cofounder of Homebrew, another early Plaid investor, said in an email that he's ""thrilled for the team who can continue to grow the value of the company to their benefit (as well as investors).""
Of course, venture capitalists are eager for exits because they're on the clock to give returns to their own investors, like pension funds, university endowments, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals. Mark Goldberg, a general partner at Index Ventures, also a Plaid investor, said he's fortunate his backers ""have a long-term view of the funds.""
""The timing is less important than the size of the outcomes,"" Goldberg said. ""Our view is that while we had a bird in hand with Visa, a little patience will really pay off in the long run.""

Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more
According to a new S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysis, with global financial services companies buying financial technology companies to bolster their positions in the data provision, software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and buy-now-pay-later, or BNPL, markets, there was no shortage of M&amp;A activity in the final months of 2020, with more deals expected in the SaaS and BNPL space.
There are many ways to define risk. Warren Buffett has said that ""risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."" Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more His mentor, Benjamin Graham, believed that risk should be measured as the chance of a permanent capital impairment of an investment. Seth Klarman also holds this view. Read More
Fintech M&amp;A 2020 Deal Tracker: Nasdaq's software pivot, Stripe enters Nigeria
With global financial services companies buying financial technology companies to bolster their positions in the data provision, software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and buy-now-pay-later, or BNPL, markets, there was no shortage of M&amp;A activity in the final months of 2020, with more deals expected in the SaaS and BNPL space.
Nasdaq Inc agreed to buy anti-money-laundering specialist Verafin Inc for $2.75 billion; Alliance Data Systems Corp. struck a deal to bought BNPL fintech Bread, also known as Lon Operations LLC, for $450 million; and Stripe Inc agreed to buy Nigerian payments company Paystack Payments Ltd. for $200 million.
S&amp;P Global Inc.'s deal to buy IHS Markit Ltd. eclipses all other fintech deals this year in terms of size, with a deal value of more than $40 billion. The merger, subject to regulatory approval, is set to unite two of Wall Street's biggest financial data providers.
In the meantime, one of the most high-profile mergers of 2020, Visa Inc.'s acquisition of data aggregator Plaid Inc., hangs in the balance after the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit citing competitive concerns in November.
Nasdaq branches out
Nasdaq's purchase of Canada-based Verafin, which provides software that helps banks to detect money laundering, will help the company grow its position in the SaaS market, analysts say.

2021-01-14,Plaid CEO touts new ‘clarity’ after failed Visa acquisition,"Yesterday, we spoke with Plaid CEO and co-founder Zach Perret after news broke that Visa no longer plans to buy his company for $5.3 billion.
The deal was heralded in early 2020 as a sign of the growing importance of fintech startups. Then it failed to close, eventually running into a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. A few months later, the acquisition was dropped.
Sentiment in the market changed since the transaction was announced. As TechCrunch reported yesterday, there’s a good deal of optimism to be found amongst investors and others that Plaid will eventually be worth more than the price at which the Visa deal valued it.
What follows is a summary of our conversation with Perret, digging into a number of topics we felt most were pressing in the wake of Plaid’s unshackling.
First and upfront: it does not appear that Plaid is racing to the public markets via a blank-check company, or SPAC, a question several readers asked on Twitter. Our impression from our chat regarding near-term liquidity via the public markets is that those with their hopes up have them up a few years too early.
TechCrunch asked Perret how it feels to be free from his erstwhile corporate boss.
He said that the last few years have been a “rollercoaster,” adding that when they made the choice to sell, it made sense at the time from mission, and delivery perspectives Visa wanted to accomplish similar things and could give his company access to a wide network of potential customers.","According to Plaid CEO Zach Perret, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a ""sea change"" in consumer behavior."
2020-12-18,A Year in Fintech in 50 Words,"This year, as every company becomes a fintech company, fintech surged into mainstream consciousness. The fallout from COVID-19 crippled the economy, depressed small businesses, and scrambled many peoples financial outlooks. But it also fueled a wave of innovation as fintech companies rose to the challenge. 
A visualization of every fintech post and podcast a16z published in 2020:
These are the fintech ideas and themes that defined the year, based on 50 of our most-used words in 2020:
For a glimpse of what’s ahead, check out The Big Ideas Fintech Will Tackle in 2021. 
Access: We decided to tackle the problem of paying for college and, more importantly, accessing higher education. We want to make it free and we want to make it accessible. And were hacking the system to make it that way. a16z Podcast: Fintech for Gen Z and Millennials, Amira Yahyaoui, Mos CEO
API: The importance of Plaid and the API market more broadly cannot be overstatedan entire generation of neobanks, lenders, and financial management tools has been made possible through programmatic access to bank transaction data. Now a new set of API providers are emerging that follow a similar pattern. Much as Plaid allowed consumers to make their bank transaction data available to fintechs, these new platforms are giving fintechs access to payroll, insurance, credit, and ERP data. The Promise of Payroll APIs, Anish Acharya, Seema Amble, and Rex Salisbury 
Banks: At present, most banks are reacting to pressure to be virtual and digitalsimultaneously shifting more than 90 percent of their employees to work virtually while operating on legacy, on-prem core banking systems that have not yet migrated into the cloud. As bank services become increasingly digital, the viability of the traditional bank branch model will be called into question. The Post-Pandemic Outlook for Banks (May 2020 fintech newsletter), Kristine Lipscomb
Brand: Brand permission and brand stretch are key concepts, particularly as non-fintech companies like Apple and Google start offering banking products and fintech companies pursue the concept of self-driving money. Though consumer attitudes toward online financial services are changing (remember how insane it seemed that people were giving Mint their bank credentials?), fintech products still face a higher bar for adoption than other types of consumer internet products. Three Questions for Fintech Product Managers, Anish Acharya
Build: Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? …There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systemswe need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems. Its Time to Build, Marc Andreessen
Credit: Its no secret that 62 million Americans are thin file, meaning they have less than four credit accounts or less than six months of credit history listed on their credit report. Another 26 million Americans are no file, with no credit history. As a result, when it comes time to apply for a mortgage, credit card, or other personal or business loan, getting a low interest rateor getting approved at allis difficult. So what are credit building products and what explains the recent interest? The Allure of New Credit Builder Products (July 2020 fintech newsletter), Seema Amble
Cash: Theres no question that the world will go cashless eventually. Accepting money electronically is better and much more efficient for the economy at large. But, at present, the fees are too high for both merchants and consumers. NYC Bans Cashless Businesses (February 2020 fintech newsletter), Alex Rampell 
COVID-19: The emergence of COVID-19 suddenly catapulted the digitization of finance into overdriveand scrambled many consumers typical budget. To examine what exactly has changed in the world of financeas well as weird and noteworthy patterns of consumer behaviorwe partnered with Glimpse, a software company that culls millions of online signals to identify surging trends. Charting the COVID Effect on Fintech, Anish Acharya, Seema Amble, Rex Salisbury, Matthieu Hafemeister, and Lauren Murrow
Data: Through sophisticated data science and machine learning, we can now unlock more data sources to better assess risk for people who lack sufficient data or are ‘credit invisible’ in the current system. Today, were swimming in far superior data (not just 5 factors!) than when our current credit-assessment systems were invented. Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company, Angela Strange
Debit: One of the most interesting trends were seeing is consumer fintech companies embracing and supercharging the debit card. When it comes to credit, millions of Americans have been burned or snubbed by traditional banks. Fintechs like Chime and Current are using this opportunity to make debit more powerful. Reimagining the Debit Card, (August 2020 fintech newsletter), Matthieu Hafemeister
Debt: The fact that people are actually talking publicly about their debt is a new behavior. In the past, spending was public but debt was private. For the first time, debt is starting to become a public conversation. The Holy Grail of Social + Fintech, Anish Acharya
Employment: It is a strange anachronism that workers receive health benefits through their employers, but not financial benefits, even though the employer is their primary source of income. Now employers are increasingly offering holistic, employee-aligned benefits like earned wage access and savings accounts, all powered by payroll APIs. The Promise of Payroll APIs, Anish Acharya, Seema Amble, and Rex Salisbury
Education: Were seeing a change in how education is being offered. Itll be interesting to see what traditional education looks like, as well as the necessity to pay for traditional education versus, say, a coding boot camp or skills-based training. Alongside that, were seeing things like ISAs pop up. a16z Podcast: Fintech for Gen Z and Millennials, Seema Amble
Emotional: Most product managers mistakenly focus on functional outcomes. Its actually much easier to impact users cognitive and emotional outcomes. Three Questions for Fintech Product Managers, Anish Acharya
Fintech:The Big Ideas Fintech Will Tackle in 2021, Alex Rampelll, Angela Strange, Anish Acharya, Seema Amble, Rex Salisbury, and Matthieu Hafemeister 
Fractional: Theres a trend around fractional ownership, driven by a category of companies that includes Rally, Otis, and Mythic. They will take some assetbe it a classic car, a culturally significant item, a Magic card, or a case of wineand theyll functionally securitize it. And then you, as a user, can purchase shares of that asset. So on the one hand, you actually have a piece of equity, a share in something that is theoretically valuable. On the other hand, you have the status of owner that is valuable in a more emotional sense. The Holy Grail of Social + Fintech, DArcy Coolican
Fraud: The fact is that I dont think limiting fraud or finding the fraudsters is all that challenging or all that expensive to do. And so even if the amount of fraud is limited, I still think that from a matter of morality, we as a society should go after the people that have stolen money from deserving businesses. a16z Podcast: Pandemic Relief and Fraud, Naftali Harris, Sentilink CEO
Free: Many fintech products are designed to appeal to the millions of consumers who have understandably shunned mainstream banking. Squares Cash App, for example, provides free banking services without a minimum balance requirement and does not charge overdraft fees. Such efforts could be even more effective if the government were to provide a number of free banking options to those who visit government websites. Want to get your check instantly next time? Get a free account here.Government Systems Are Strained by COVID. Fintech Can Help. (November 2020 fintech newsletter), Angela Strange
Future: In the not-too-distant future, I believe nearly every company will derive a significant portion of its revenue from financial services. Every company, even those that have nothing to do with financial services, will have the opportunity to benefit from fintech for the first time. Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company, Angela Strange
Gen Z: How do you expect the most educated, the most intelligent, but also the most cynical generation to trust banking institutions? There is an incredible, beautiful change in consumer behavior among Gen Z, which has probably the biggest bullshit detector of all consumers. So if you are trying to trick the user in some flow or some ad, that just doesnt work anymore. a16z Podcast: Fintech for Gen Z and Millennials, Amira Yahyaoui, Mos CEO
Government: When it comes to connecting 10 million small businesses to the largest stimulus package in history, the government has a distribution problem. The government is becoming increasingly reliant on the help of fintech to enable the discovery and distribution of aid and benefits. Just last week, companies including Paypal, Square, and Intuit were tapped to assist the government with its coronavirus relief program. Fintech Can Solve the Governments Distribution Problem (April 2020 fintech newsletter), Anish Acharya 
Growth: If you looked solely at the stock market, the economic view would seem oddly optimistic. Since March lows, youd see a record-breaking 45+ percent increase in the S&amp;P. That narrow lens would indicate a seemingly strong economy and tremendous growth momentum. However, the stock market is rarely a good indication of what is actually going on in the economy. Assessing COVID-19s Impact Through the Banks (July 2020 fintech newsletter), Matthieu Hafemeister
Help: Many fintech companies have stepped up to help consumers and small businesses through the pandemic. That effort includes disbursing stimulus checks, distributing Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to businesses, providing access to unemployment benefits, and offering data and infrastructure assistance. Heres a comprehensivebut by no means completelist of fintech companies helping those impacted by COVID-19. 35 Fintech Companies Aiding in Coronavirus Relief, Seema Amble
Homeownership: I call these companies the new guard of homeownership. Theyre fundamentally rethinking how we access a home. The nuance here is that theyre not only providing use, experience, and access, theyre also adding a fourth dimension: a return on your financial investment. Were at the start of a wave that is going to fundamentally change the way consumers purchase, and ultimately own, a home. A Novel Path to Homeownership, Adena Hefets, Divvy Homes CEO
Insurance: One in 10 Fortune 500 companies is an insurance company, but all of those companies were started back before World War II. Not only is our current insurance system outdated, but from a consumers point of view, its also highly inconvenient: I purchase my asset (house, car, lease on an office), but then I have to go somewhere else to buy insurance. It would be natural and highly advantageous to be able to embed insurance at the point of purchase.” The Big Ideas Fintech Will Tackle in 2021, Angela Strange
Investors: Today, more companies are finding ways to connect and engage with retail investors, parlaying that relationship into a competitive advantage. Since these investors are financially married to the success of the company, they can be effective advocates in fostering brand loyalty and trust within their communities. In some cases, this shifting power dynamic is happening at a deeper level: businesses are turning their most loyal customers into investors. Retail Investors Are Becoming More Than Shareholders (October 2020 fintech newsletter), Matthieu Hafemeister
Jobs: Having just one job for life, thats over. People are going to have multiple jobs in their careerand maybe multiple jobs at the same timeand they wont necessarily have to congregate in the same city centers. The way that we work and the way that we make money is going to change dramatically. a16z Podcast: Fintech for Gen Z and Millennials, Anish Acharya
Kids: As more and more companies offer financial services, fintech and non-fintech companies are making a play for the loyalties of younger and younger customers. This means that your kids first bank may someday look more like a debit card with loyalty points for Robucks, rather than a piggy bank. Fintech Makes a Play for Gen Z (July 2020  fintech newsletter), Angela Strange
Lending: COVID-19 has prompted a scramble in the world of online SMB lending, as delinquencies pile up. But the resulting shift is correcting long-standing issues in small business lending around distribution and risk selection. Two new lending modelsembedded loans and lending layered with other financial productsoffer a streamlined application process and faster approval than traditional SMB loans. Better Models for SMB Lending (August 2020 fintech newsletter), Seema Amble
Local: Fintech is default local, not default global. Unlike software or a social network that can be turned on in any geography, fintech products must receive local regulatory approval, offer local payment methods, and work with local bank partnersall of which takes time, talent, money, and oftentimes a significant, dedicated team. Additionally, over the last 10 years, local fintech players have emerged around the world, posing formidable competition for foreign entrants. Big Fintech Players Seek Partners to Go Global (June 2020 fintech newsletter), Seema Amble
Mortgage: Residential mortgages are one of the largest asset classes in the world, with over $10 trillion in debt outstanding10 times more than credit cards and student loans. And, of course, a functioning mortgage market is hugely important to the health of the American economy. Rates are now at an historic low, falling below 3 percent for the first time in history and driving origination volumes to all time-highs. What Rocket Mortgage Can Teach Us About the Future of Financial Services (July 2020 fintech newsletter), Rex Salisbury 
Neobanks: The U.S.-based neobanks that have seen the most traction to date have largely focused on underserved or unbanked consumers, those typically not sought after by big banks, since high servicing costs make low balance accounts unprofitable. So why are neobanks now taking an active interest in prime consumers? The calculus is obvious: Theyre betting they can lure these profitable customers away from incumbent banks with substantially better bundled perks. Neobanks Plan to Woo Prime Customers: Better Bundles (January 2020 fintech newsletter), Rex Salisbury
Open source: Any company should be able to compose a customized financial solution to meet the unique needs of its customers. With todays banking-as-a-service players, we are only partially there. The ideal solution will support modular development and an ability to plug into legacy environments. The same transformation occurred in cloud computing, with the introduction of programmatic, open source building blocks. Investing in Moov: Open Source Financial Services Building Blocks, Angela Strange
Online: The shift toward online banking has been accelerated by COVID: At Square, direct deposit volumes grew three times over from March to April, up to $1.3 billion; Chime saw record signups. And traditional banks and credit unions witnessed a 50 percent increase in mobile banking engagement since the beginning of the year. COVID-19 Drives Digital Acceleration in Finance (May 2020 fintech newsletter), Rex Salisbury
Partner banks: “Partner banks, chartered institutions that provide fintech companies access to banking products, have exploded in recent yearsby our count, their ranks have grown more than five times over the past decade. We aim to provide greater visibility into this interconnected and expanding ecosystem: the partner banks, the fintech companies, and the many services these partnerships afford for small businesses and consumers. The Partner Bank Boom, Rex Salisbury and Anish Acharya
Payroll: Just as Plaid has opened the door to a new wave of fintech integrations, payroll-connected APIs are poised to vastly improve underwriting, upgrade employee-provided financial benefits, and streamline and scale consumer and enterprise fintech companies alike. The Promise of Payroll APIs, Anish Acharya, Seema Amble, and Rex Salisbury
PPP (Paycheck Protection Program): Honestly, I was frustrated after PPP came out and so much of the focus was on a handful of big companies that got money and were essentially shamed into returning it. There was far more focus on that issue than on the fact that tens of thousands of companies that were eligible werent getting the money, and that a disproportionate number of them were owned by Black or Hispanic owners because they lacked traditional banking relationships or there werent banks participating in the program in their area. That, to me, is a much bigger tragedy than a couple of burger chains getting money they shouldnt have. a16z Podcast: Pandemic Relief and Fraud, Bharat Ramamurti, member of the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission
Process: An IPO is far from perfect, but the cynical narrative that evil investment bankers are intentionally underpricing traditional IPOs to steal from companies is almost completely false. To understand why first requires taking apart the IPO process, how stock markets work, and what the price of a stock means. In Defense of the IPO, and How to Improve It, Alex Rampell and Scott Kupor
QR Code: During the first wave of lockdowns and social-distancing measures in March, many predicted that 2020 would be the year that QR code payments would finally see broad U.S. adoption. It made sense: a no-touch QR code is safer than contact payment methods like cash or cards. So why hasnt QR code payment caught on? Will COVID Make QR Code Payments Go Mainstream? (November 2020 fintech newsletter), Matthieu Hafemeister 
Real Estate: Productivity seems just as high, if not higher. Therefore companies are saying, ‘Hey, why don’t we just have everyone work from home?’ That obviously has massive implications on commercial real estate. It has an impact on housing. What does that do in terms of portability, and almost arbitraging housing cost versus employment income? a16z Podcast: Real Estate in a Pandemic: Homeowners and Buyers, Alex Rampell
SaaS: “Fintech is driving the next evolution of vertical SaaS. While early vertical SaaS companies such as Mindbody, Toast, and Shopify typically started by reselling financial services (primarily payments), they are now embedding financial products beyond payments directly into their vertical software. Fintech Scales Vertical SaaS, Kristina Shen, Kimberly Tan, Seema Amble, and Angela Strange 
Social: We anticipate the emergence of new fintech products that are social+: those that have more utility when you use them with others, creating a functional (and often emotional) incentive for users to help drive distribution. There are a number of exciting companies that are catalyzing this change alreadyStir, Braid, Commonstock, Public, and Yotta among them. Not only do multiplayer products have built-in growth levers, they make activity around moneyinvesting, financial planning, even savingmore engaging. Fun, even!” The Big Ideas Fintech Will Tackle in 2021, Anish Acharya
Stimulus: The largest stimulus package in history provides $350 billion to assist small businesses, but the last mile of identifying, adjudicating, and disbursing assistance without a sea of fraud is a new challenge, one that the government is wholly unprepared for, and for which technology is the needed answer. Now. Small Businesses Depend on the Stimulus Package. The Stimulus Will Depend on Fintech, Alex Rampell
Students: Student debt in the U.S. now totals more than $1.6 trillion. And 7 in 10 college seniors are graduating with debt. So I do think that Gen Z in particular views their parents and to some extent millennials as a cautionary tale. a16z Podcast: Fintech for Gen Z and Millennials, Lauren Murrow
Trading: Over the past few months, the major brokerage platforms have seen significant growth in both trading volume and new account creation, much of it by young and first-time traders. Of course, a number of new trading platforms have cropped up over the past 5 to 10 yearsincluding Robinhood, Stash, and othersthat appeal to millennials and Gen-Zers with commission-free, mobile-first, easy to use products. Older brokerages are feeling the threat. Online Brokerages Compete for New Millennial Investors (May 2020 fintech newsletter), Seema Amble
Underwriting: Many incumbent lenders are constrained by rigid credit models. Miss a payment? Youre now a significantly worse credit risk. In contrast, many newer fintech lenders use additive models, such as cash flow underwriting or additional signals, to develop a deeper understanding and longer-term view of each consumers unique financial situation. By providing more flexibility, these fintech lenders may enable their customers to come out better on the other side. For Fintech, A Heightened Sense of Purpose (March 2020 fintech newsletter), Angela Strange
Vertical: In a world of increasingly generic product experiences and rising acquisition costs, fintech companies are pursuing a marketing advantage through vertical banking: services tailored to specific customer communities. Fintech Pursues Vertical Banking (November 2020 fintech newsletter), Anish Acharya
Wealth: Last month, the SEC adopted amendments to the definition of accredited investors, which determines what types of investors can invest in different offerings. While the previous rules took a wealth-first approach to accreditation meant to ensure that individuals could sustain losses, should their investments fail to materialize this new, broader definition adds an element of investor sophistication. What the SECs New Accreditation Definition Means For Startups (September 2020 fintech newsletter), Matthieu Hafemeister
Yield: We called 2019 the year of high-yield savings accounts, as companies including Betterment, Wealthfront, SoFi, Robinhood, and Credit Karma pursued prime customers. However, the collapse of the Fed funds rate to near zero caused fintech companies to likewise drop their yields. Now a new category of companies is emerging that delivers high yields via a different vehicle: crypto securities lending. An Emerging Model for High-Yield Savings (July 2020 fintech newsletter), Anish Acharya
Zero: There are a couple likely factors behind the piqued interest in brokerage accounts. When interest rates are lowthey dropped to zero in Marchreturns on bonds and savings accounts are low and cash yield is zero. Thus, investors spend more time looking for alternatives to invest more of their capital into the markets.

2020-12-22,CleanSpark: Using The Bitcoin Acquisition To Showcase The Future Of Energy,"I like adding a few speculative stocks to a diversified portfolio to improve returns and I've had a pretty good runrecently, so I figured why not continue my research into high-growth small-cap stocks. I stumbled upon CleanSpark (CLSK) recently, and while I do have some concerns, I believe the explosive growth potential of its microgrid business outweighs the potential risks. Imperfect information is just a fact with high-growth small-cap investing. Let's dive into the analysis.
Business Overview
Just a brief background on the company, CleanSpark is a software and control technology solutions provider for the energy industry, specifically targeting microgrids. Specifically, the companys software platforms make microgrids happen by providing end-to-end intelligent energy monitoring and controls, microgrid design software, energy market communications, and management solutions.
So, what exactly is a microgrid? According to Vox, a grid is any combination of power sources, power users, wires to connect them, and some sort of control system to operate it all. Microgrid just means a small, freestanding grid. This ties to cleaner more renewable energy due to the somewhat unreliable nature of wind and solar. You can only generate electricity from these sources when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. So, the theory is every individual house/building could generate power from renewable sources for not only its own consumption but also contribute power to other end users via a web of multiple microgrids. The microgrid architecture has the advantages of possibly being greener, being able to disconnect from the main grid to avoid total power outage, and more efficient.
Vox Article: Microgrid
This company has been around for a while yet never made any meaningful revenue or net income. However, there are certain developments in recent years that make the microgrid solution more feasible, namely the large decreases of solar panel costs and significant improvements in battery storage. The total microgrid market is expected to be around $40 billion by 2028 with capacity at 20 GW representing an annual growth of 21.4%.
According to the 10-K, the company essentially has these software platforms summarized below:
<ul><li>mVSO Platform: Energy modeling software for microgrid design and sales.</li><li>mPulse Platform: Patented, proprietary controls platform that enables integration and optimization of multiple energy sources.</li><li>Canvas: Middleware used by Grid Operators and Aggregators to administrate load shifting programs.</li><li>Plaid: Middleware used by Controls and IoT Product Companies to participate in load shifting programs</li></ul>
Investor Presentation
Earnings Analysis
The company recently ended its fiscal year (September 2020) and the results were decent but not great. The company missed on revenue projections for Q3 and Q4 which is a bit worrying for a high growth company but showed decent full-year results. CleanSparks revenue grew by 122% to $10.0 million from $4.5 million the prior year. While this revenue growth may seem impressive, note that it is coming from a relatively low base compared to expectations as the companys market cap is about $440 million. This puts the company at the higher end of a P/S ratio of about 44x.
Like most growth companies, CleanSpark is operating at a loss. In fiscal 2020, the company had an operating loss of -$15.1 million, an improvement of only $1.5 million from 2019 despite the doubling of revenue. The increase in expenses for the year was mainly due to increases in professional fees and payroll expenses. I am particularly not a fan of these large professional fee payments for consulting and legal.
The product development expense is also pretty low, but its entirely possible that engineering salaries are a part of payroll expenses. Unfortunately, research and development is not broken out into its own separate item or disclosed in the notes. Having a low amount of R&amp;D would be worrying for a company whose competitive advantage lies in its software platforms. However, we cannot verify this as fact, therefore these constitute yellow flags for me and are key risks that investors need to be aware of.
""Professional fees increased to $6,521,016 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from $4,829,038 for the same period ended September 30, 2019. Our professional fees expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted mainly of consulting fees of $607,392 paid to management of the Company, stock-based compensation for consulting of $2,265,194, sales consulting of $278,547, legal fees of $1,472,421, investor relations and external marketing consulting of $725,347, director fees of $442,000, consulting for software and engineering of $82,031, accounting and tax fees of $186,969 and audit and review fees of $135,060.""

Momentum is building
On the plus side, the company has been scoring wins lately in terms of contracts and orders. During the fiscal year, the company received $470,000 of grant funding for its microgrid design and software from the state of California; announced a partnership with Sunshine Energy, which is one of the largest energy developers in Costa Rica; and secured a contract to provide intelligent switchgear upgrades and support for a US Embassy in Africa. While none of these are slam-dunk wins on their own, they are a show of confidence in the companys products and services and a start to potentially more future contracts. To shore up its technological advantage, the company also recently acquired GridFabric which creates software solutions that help power utilities and IoT.
CleanSparks most interesting acquisition, though, is its latest one. The company recently acquired ATL Data Centre, a cryptocurrency miner with 3,471 bitcoin mining units, for $19.4M in common stock. Bitcoin has seen a surge in interest lately with the price rising more than 200% YTD. Interest has been high from the institutional side as well as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) have gotten onboard the cryptocurrency.
Source: Forbes Article on Bitcoin
Bitcoin mining is extremely energy-intensive and miners are often located in countries where the cost of electricity is substantially cheaper. CleanSpark can use its energy management technology to lower total energy expense, thus increase overall profitability. If this energy comes from renewable sources, this effectively creates a vertically integrated production operation of bitcoin where energy is the raw material. The company has the optionality of a lot of potential upside should the price of bitcoin continue to rise.
More important than trying to profit off bitcoin price appreciation, though, is having the bitcoin mining operations work as a proof of concept for CleanSparks energy management technology. Bitcoin mining is the perfect showcase because it uses a lot of energy and doesn't require any other specialized knowledge to run (as opposed to the company acquiring a manufacturing firm which would need a sales team, branding, R&amp;D, etc.).
The sales cycle for energy infrastructure can be pretty long; after all, the US grid itself hasnt been upgraded in decades. The average age of the US electric transmission infrastructure is roughly 40 years old with a quarter of the installed base fifty years or older. In other words, the sales cycle to the government or utilities for grid improvements via microgrids will most probably be extremely long and thus CleanSpark will need to find a way to convince private enterprises to use its technology.
If the companys bitcoin operations can exist as an island microgrid that is cost-efficient and sustainable, it might encourage other industries to adopt this architecture as well. If the company can show large improvements in energy efficiency, it can more easily sell this technology to other energy intensive industries such as manufacturing and data centers. In particular, I see data centers as a massive potential customer for CleanSpark as they use a lot of energy and computing power like bitcoin mining and, in recent years, are trying to go more green. Only time will tell if the company will succeed with this approach.
Investor Takeaway
As mentioned, in terms of valuation, CleanSpark is trading at roughly a P/S ratio of 44x which is on the expensive side. The company, though, has a lot of room for continued revenue growth with the total microgrid market expected to be around $40 billion by 2028. While there are some yellow flags in terms of R&amp;D spending and competition from much larger incumbents, I think the company has a pathway to success. The company recently closed its private offering raising $40 million, ensuring the company would have sufficient liquidity. I have the company as a very high risk, speculative buy.

2020-12-14,3 Robinhood Stocks that Analysts Think Will Move Higher,"Robinhood has been the most used platform by Millennials for stock trading due to its zero-commissions policy. As more and more Millennials are starting to take an active interest in the stock markets, the Robinhood platform has climbed to more than 13 million users. This can be attributed to the rallying stock market over the last two quarters despite economic weakness. With rising rates of unemployment and remote working freeing up more screen time, a large proportion of millennials have taken up active trading.
It should be no surprise that the tech savvy generation has taken a liking to some of the biggest tech stocks in the world. While many investors are shifting their focus to outdoor stocks in light of recent coronavirus vaccine approval and a potential broad rollout of vaccinations very soon, Millennials have been taking advantage of the market dip because  they expect the prices to rebound in the foreseeable future.
While the vaccine’s development did lead to a tech sell-off last month, analysts expect big names in this sector to recover quickly as the services offered by these companies are likely to remain in demand.
With most millennials trading heavily in the biggest tech companies, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN - Get Rating), Visa, Inc. (V - Get Rating) and Sony Corporation (SNE - Get Rating) have secured their position in the top 20  of 100 most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform.
Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN - Get Rating)
As the largest e-commerce company in the world, AMZN has been one of the biggest gainers in the pandemic. With average trading volume of 4.82 million, AMZN is the fourth most actively traded stock on the Robinhood 100 list.
Despite gaining 67.8% year-to-date, analysts expect AMZN to move higher over the coming months. This is due mainly to a rampant second wave of coronavirus infections that has hit most countries around the world. Analysts expect AMZN’s price to reach $3830.49, indicating a 20.2% rise from the current price.
This comes in despite the current antitrust charges levied against the company by the US government and European Union because the company has been implementing an ambitious expansion strategy to increase its market reach. AMZN is currently building multiple fulfilment centers across the country, as well as developing its cloud services segment (AWS). As the demand for cloud services continues to rise amid the remote working and learning culture, AWS has emerged as one of the top three largest cloud computing companies and is poised to expand further into the Indian and European markets.
AMZN launched Amazon Pharmacy for online prescription medication sales on November 19. The online drug sales e-commerce platform delivers several savings benefits, with up to 80% savings on no-prescription medication. With a second wave of COVID-19 raging across the US, coupled with high unemployment, AMZN pharmacies should witness high demand as people order medication online to garner savings while remaining socially distant.
AMZN’s net sales have increased 37% year-over-year to $96.10 billion in the third quarter ended September 30.Net income grew 200% from the year-ago value to $6.30 billion, while EPS rose 192.4% from the same period last year to $12.37.
The consensus EPS estimate of $7.09 for the quarter ending December 31 represents a 9.6% rise year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history; it beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. The consensus revenue estimate of $119.44 billion for the current quarter represents a 36.6% rise from the year-ago value. AMZN gained more than 115% to hit its 52-week high of $3,552.25 in September since hitting its 52-week low of $1626.03 in March.
How does AMZN stack up for the POWR Ratings?
B for Trade Grade
B for Buy &amp; Hold Grade
A for Industry Rank
B for Overall POWR Rating.
The stock is currently ranked #17 out of 59 stocks in the Internet industry.
Visa, Inc. (V - Get Rating)
V is one of the largest global financial payments processing companies in the world. It has been thriving in the pandemic. As the demand for online transactions have increased significantly under the lockdown, customers and merchants have adopted virtual payments across the globe. V’s position as the largest commercial payments card network has made it one of the most actively traded stocks in the US, with an average trading volume of 7.89 million. It is currently ranked #18 in the Robinhood 100 list.
With the technological advancements currently underway, most developed countries have become virtually cash free, while developing and underdeveloped parts of the world are witnessing a significant rise in the digital transactions volume. With many countries now developing and testing their digital currencies, V’s industry knowledge as the leading payment processor is key in facilitating international transactions through this means.
Analysts expect V’s price to rise 8.15% to $225 in the near future. The company’s recent acquisition of YellowPepper and Plaid contributes heavily to this bullish expectation because it allows V to strengthen its position as a global industry leader. On November 23, the company entered a strategic partnership with Visa Commercial Pay to streamline transactions in the B2B segment. This should bring in a higher volume of customers for V, as most businesses are currently operating remotely.
V’s payments volume and processed transactions increased 4% and 3% year-over-year, respectively, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30. Revenue from the data processing segment rose 4% versus the same period last year to $2.88 billion, while revenue from the “Other” segment grew 5% from its year-ago value to $361 million.
The consensus EPS estimate of $5.45 for the current year represents an 8.1% rise year-over-year. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history as well; it beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the railing four quarters. The consensus revenue estimate of $23.22 billion for the current year indicates a 6.3% rise from the same period last year. V has gained more than 50% since hitting its 52-week low of $133.93 in March.
It is no surprise that V is rated “Strong Buy” in our proprietary POWR ratings system, with an “A” for Trade Grade and “Buy &amp; Hold Grade, and “B” for Peer Grade and Industry Rank. In the 96-stock Consumer Financial Services industry, V is currently ranked #1.
Sony Corporation (SNE - Get Rating)
SNE operates in multiple segments in the virtual entertainment industry –from developing hardware such as television, cameras and play stations to designing and producing gaming software, motion pictures and music. Based in Japan, SNE has become a household name in most parts of the world. The company is the fifth most actively traded stock on the Robinhood platform, with an average trading volume of 1.09 million.
Analysts expect SNE to gain 7.3% to hit $100.65. The company’s diversified product range and international market reach makes it well positioned to grow despite macroeconomic factors because it enjoys substantial brand loyalty. The company launched PlayStation 5 in November, which has already proven to be a big hit. It is currently working on the Airpeak project, which designs and manufactures drones for commercial purposes. This, coupled with its recent acquisitions of anime developer Ellation Holdings and media production company Nevion, should drive the business to new highs.
SNE’s operating income rose 14% year-over-year to ¥317.80 billion in the fiscal second quarter ended September 30. Its adjusted EBIT grew 14% from the same period last year to ¥299.60 billion, while net income increased 145% from the year-ago value to ¥459.60 billion.
The consensus EPS estimate of $0.31 for the next quarter ending March 31, 2021 indicates a 210% rise year-over-year. Moreover, SNE beat the Street EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, which bodes well for the stock. The consensus revenue estimate of $19.10 billion for the next quarter indicates a 21.4% rise from the same period last year.
SNE has gained more than 85% since hitting its 52-week low of $50.94 in March. The stock hit its 52-week high of $94.97 earlier today.
SNE is rated “Strong Buy” in our POWR Ratings system, with an “A” for Trade Grade, Buy &amp; Hold Grade and Peer Grade, and “B” for Industry Rank. It is currently ranked #1 of 21 stocks in the Entertainment – Media Producers industry.

In November the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit stating Visa is a “monopolist in online debt transactions”, and the acquisition would eliminate a nascent competitive threat that would likely result in substantial savings and more innovative online debit services for merchants and consumers. 
Plaid, which helps companies connect to users bank accounts, claims to have had an unprecedented uptick in demand amid the pandemic. 
Since launching in 2013, the fintech has grown to hold connections with 10,000 banks and reach more than 20m consumer bank accounts.

2021-01-15,Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan Chase should absolutely be 'scared s---less' about fintech threat,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has watched while a new breed of fintech players, led by PayPal, Square and tech giants around the world including e-commerce giant Alibaba have skyrocketed in users and market cap.
His message to the management team of his $3.4 trillion banking goliath: Be frightened.
""Absolutely, we should be scared s---less about that,"" Dimon said Friday in a conference call with analysts. ""We have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We've just got to get quicker, better, faster... As you look at what we've done, you'd say we've done a good job, but the other people have done a good job too.""
Dimon's blunt assessment was in response to questioning from analysts including Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo who pointed out that with rich, tech-like valuations, fintech players have ""trounced"" the traditional banks in recent years.
Dimon said that he sent his deputies a list of global competitors, and that PayPal, Square, Stripe, Ant Financial as well as U.S. tech giants including Amazon, Apple and Google were names the bank needs to keep an eye on. The rivals are also clients of the firm's commercial and investment banking in many cases, he added.
Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments, he noted: ""I expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next ten years,"" Dimon said. ""I expect to win, so help me God.""
Dimon added that in some cases, the new players were ""examples of unfair competition"" that the bank would do something about eventually. He included players that take advantage of richer debit-card revenue for small banks and firms Dimon accused of not doing proper anti-money laundering precautions.
He specifically called out Plaid, the payments start-up whose acquisition by Visa recently collapsed:
""People who improperly use data that's been given to them, like Plaid.""
Plaid CEO Zach Perrett declined to directly respond to the accusation during an interview with CNBC's David Faber, adding that Plaid is spending time with the bank on a partnership.","Dimon's blunt assessment was in response to questioning from analysts who pointed out the rich, tech-like valuations of fintech players."

Zach Perret CEO and cofounder of Plaid
Plaid
Visa's $5.3 billion deal for Plaid wasn't the biggest of 2020, but its implications were far reaching.
Plaid is the startup you might not have heard of, but have definitely used. The fintech essentially acts as the back-end piping for the world of digital finance, connecting banks and third-party apps — such as Betterment and Coinbase — with each other.
Visa's plan to acquire Plaid in January 2020 was big news, as it seemed like the card network positioning itself for the future.
Fast forward a year, and throw in an antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice, and the two sides have agreed to part ways, axing the deal.

<ul><li>Prepared Remarks</li><li>Questions and Answers</li><li>Call Participants</li></ul>Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Vera Bradley Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Dely, Vera Bradley's Chief Administrative Officer.
Mark Dely -- Chief Administrative Officer
Good morning and welcome, everyone. We'd like to thank you for joining us for Vera Bradley's earnings call.
Some of the statements made during our prepared remarks and in response to your questions may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to and within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such forward-looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expect.
Please refer to today's press release and the company's most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC for a discussion of known risks and uncertainties. Investors should not assume that the statements made during the call will remain operative at a later time. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on the call.
I will now turn it over to Vera Bradley's CEO, Rob Wallstrom. Rob?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. John Enwright, our CFO, also joins me today. Our quarterly results once again significantly exceeded last year's earnings performance as well as our expectations. We expanded our gross margin rate primarily through sales of cotton masks and controlled promotional activity and we diligently managed our expenses achieving meaningful expense leverage.
Our multi-brand strategy is proving to be powerful. Customers are changing the way they shop and we have responded. Our digital competencies are becoming increasingly important, especially in this quickly evolving environment. Somewhat fortuitously, last year, we acquired digitally native Pura Vida and began working on critical Vera Bradley technology infrastructure and e-commerce site improvements, necessary to position the company for future success. Those are the enhancements went live several months ago.
Our consolidated e-commerce business was very strong in the third quarter, reflecting growth from both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida. Even as our stores were reopened during the third quarter, our Vera Bradley Digital business grew nearly 50% year-over-year and Pura Vida's e-commerce sales grew over 17% for the quarter despite disruptions in the supply chain. E-commerce sales comprised over a third of total sales for the quarter.
By staying laser-focused on the customer and by controlling what we can't control, we have proven we can drive strong results and position ourselves to emerge a stronger and more resilient company despite facing ongoing headwinds. Our results were achieved through the innovation, teamwork and determination of our entire organization. Even while working remotely, our teams have demonstrated flexibility in decision-making, created new products and marketing initiatives and added efficiency to the organization. And our focus on cash management has driven us to think of creative ways to drive sales, expand margins and reduce expenses.
Let me turn the call over to John to review the financial results. John?
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Rob, and good morning. Let me go over a few highlights for the third quarter. As a reminder, financial results have been consolidated to include the July 2019 Pura Vida acquisition. This is the first quarter since the acquisition that the year-over-year quarters are comparable.
The numbers I will discuss today are all non-GAAP. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please reference the schedules attached to today's press release. The current year non-GAAP third quarter income statement numbers exclude intangible asset amortization. The non-GAAP income statement numbers for the prior year third quarter exclude the Pura Vida acquisition-related charges and technology replatforming expenses.
Consolidated net revenues totaled $124.8 million for the current year third quarter compared to $127.5 million in the prior year third quarter. Excluding charges, Vera Bradley Incorporated's non-GAAP consolidated net income was $10.2 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the third quarter compared to $6.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share last year.
Vera Bradley Direct segment revenues totaled $78.2 million compared to $78.4 million in the prior year third quarter. E-commerce sales growth of 48.8% offset the 19.1% decline in comparable store sales for the quarter. Store traffic continues to be negatively impacted by the pandemic. The company closed 10 full-line stores and opened six factory outlet stores in the last 12 months.
Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues totaled $22.3 million compared to $24.1 million in the prior year third quarter, reflecting a reduction in orders primarily related to the pandemic and in the number of specialty and department store accounts. Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $24.3 million compared to $25 million in the prior year third quarter, a 17.2% growth in e-commerce sales nearly offset the sale to wholesale accounts, which were negatively affected by the pandemic.
Third quarter consolidated gross profit totaled $73.8 million or 59.1% of net revenues compared to $74.1 million or 58.1% of net revenues in the prior year on a non-GAAP basis. The company expanded its gross margin in the quarter primarily through sales of cotton masks and controlled promotional activity.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated third quarter SG&amp;A expense totaled $59.4 million or 47.6% of net revenues compared to $64 million or 50.2% of net revenues. Current year SG&amp;A expenses were lower than the prior year due to both temporary and permanent expense reductions related to the pandemic. On a non-GAAP basis, current year third quarter consolidated operating income totaled $14.4 million or 11.6% compared to $10.1 million or 7.9% of net revenues last year.
The uncertainties continuing related to COVID-19 make fourth quarter financial performance extremely difficult to predict. As a result, we are not providing forward-looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we believe our inventories are well positioned and marketing initiatives will drive traffic and sales. However, third quarter performance should not be considered a predictor of future performance. We are facing certain headwinds in the fourth quarter, including the continued impact of COVID-19 on store traffic and capacity limitations in stores. Net sales may not be as strong for the fourth quarter and freight is a fairly significant headwind for all retailers as the consumer over indexes to e-commerce. Shippers are applying surcharges to each package during peak season and we have elected to absorb that cost and not pass along to the consumer.
Now, let me turn to the balance sheet. Net capital spending for the third quarter and nine months totaled $900,000 and $5.2 million respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to total between $6 million to $7 million for the year, primarily related to technology and logistic enhancements as well as new factory stores.
Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of October 31st, 2020 totaled $77.3 million compared to $48.8 million at the end of last year's third quarter. We have $30 million of borrowings outstanding on our $75 million credit facility at the end of the quarter. Quarter end inventory is $141.6 million compared to $134 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Current year inventory was higher than the prior year, primarily due to receipts accelerated into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. We expect year-over-year inventory to be relatively flat at fiscal year-end.
Rob?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, John. Now let's shift to an update on our two brands. We believe the way that customers live and work has radically and permanently changed. Both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida are particularly well suited with our purpose-driven casual, comfortable and fun positioning that dovetails perfectly into this consumer shift. We remain focused on propelling both brands forward through innovation and product and marketing, supported by state-of-art technology. Our new cloud-based technology platform is allowing us to respond to the rapidly changing environment and to harness customer data and feedback earlier and more instantaneously to drive this innovation.
First, let me update you on Vera Bradley. Let's start with product. I am very proud of the fabric and product innovation being driven by our talented design, creative and product development teams. We have a robust fabric innovation pipeline in place to continually update our cotton collection to develop new fabric offerings and to build on our platform of sustainable fabrics. This pipeline is important to our existing customers and helps us attract new customers to the brand. Our full-line offerings have performed well and our recycled reactive collections continue to gain traction and are highly rated by our customers. In the recent introduction, our ultra-light fabrication has been a popular addition to our factory stores. Stay tuned for more fabric innovation over the next 12 to 24 months.
We also continue to introduce differentiated styles and silhouettes, providing our customers beautiful solutions in all facets of the life. One key focus is our hands-free products like our sling backpacks and cross bodies as they have become increasingly important to our customers, particularly during the pandemic. Our long-term focus continues to be on building on our dominance in our three core franchise areas of youth campus, every day and travel.
Our travel segment has held up relatively well during this period. Our product focus on soft travel items like our duffel and weekender collection for car trips or weekend getaways, it's proving to be more resilient than the hard luggage market in general. We continue to innovate and travel. For example, we are launching our ReActive lay flat travel backpack, which takes our award-winning lay flat functionality into our core backpack category.
A great example of innovation has been our cotton mask, which once again drove meaningful revenue in gross margin dollars for us during the quarter. We have continued to improve our offerings with new features, style, sizes, patterns and solids and we are happy to provide our customers and the communities we serve with much needed personal protective equipment and provide a bit of Vera Bradley's signature color and fun in the process.
Net sales softened as we progress through the third quarter but still comprised approximately 10% of Vera Bradley's total sales. While we expect the sales of masks will continue to soften in the fourth quarter and beyond, we are beginning to experience recovery in the core business, which is offset the mask volume decline in third quarter. Our trend light, colors and patterns continue to be important to our customers. Paisley remained our number one brand, but our customers are also drawn to our emotional novelty prints and smaller soon-to-sell out capsule collections. These always add excitement to our assortments and a sense of urgency for our customers to shop. Our Best in Show Dog Print launched in the third quarter was a fan favorite and even topped last year's wildly popular Cat's Meow pattern.
This holiday season comes with a focus on gifting and cozy and a combination of festive and whimsical patterns like Merry Mischief in coordinating classics and neutral textures like our Teddy Fleece and Cozy Plaid. We are offering an expanded assortment with customer favorites like blankets, slippers and cold weather accessories and we expanded cozy into more apparel like lounge wear robes, puffer jackets and fleece. These items have sold out quickly.
Our collaborations in strategic partnerships continue to engage existing and new customers expand our reach, increase brand awareness, generate media attention and provide opportunities for us to strategically test and ultimately enter new product categories. We are continually approached by well-known brands with collaboration and partnership opportunities, which speak to the strength and wide appeal of the Vera Bradley brand. In August, we launched our newest Disney collection on verabradley.com and our second annual collaboration with Crocs.
In October, we introduced our signature masks and 1982 Backpacks in Target stores and on target.com. And earlier this month, we were able to replenish and add to our extraordinarily popular Vera Bradley plus Harry Potter collaboration that originally launched in July and sold out quickly and look for more exciting collaborations in 2021.
Let me switch to marketing and customer engagement. Our talented digital and marketing teams have completely transformed the way we communicate and engage with our customers and touch the communities we serve. As we focus on reinforcing our position as an ESG organization, we continue to strengthen our community support and charitable efforts under the umbrella of VB Cares, particularly through organizations that could profoundly improve the lives of women and children. Even though we were unable to hold any large fundraising events this year, through the generosity of our associates, customers and other supporters, we were able to raise $1.4 million to support lifesaving research at the Vera Bradley Foundation Center for Breast Cancer Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, bringing the total rates to date in support of breast cancer research is $36 million.
Additionally, we are continuing our yearlong support of other impactful organizations like New Hope Girls and Blessings in a Backpack. Another aspect of BSG and our VB Cares focus is caring for our associates. We are so thankful for all of our associates and are especially grateful to those that have served on the frontlines making sure our customers have safe and exceptional experiences day in and day out, especially during the pandemic. We were once again thrilled to award a quarterly bonus of up to $500 based on hours worked to each distribution center store and customer service associates for their continued contribution and devotion to Vera Bradley during this extraordinary time. Over the last two quarters, we have paid over $800,000 in well-deserved bonuses to our front line associates.
In the third quarter, we successfully launched our new verabradley.com site, which allowed us to improve our customers' online buying experience and offer enhanced content to guide purchasing. We added a number of key site capabilities and have experienced a triple-digit improvement in revenue attributed to our search engine optimization. Our digital and marketing teams have been successful in accelerating digital and customer growth. Our well-timed investments in customer data science, business analytics and AI positioned us well as we have navigated through the pandemic, allowing up to collect and analyze data and respond to customer changes and adjust marketing spend in an agile way.
Using our data-centric program buying, we have significantly increased our paid media efficiency and revenue attributable to paid media during the quarter. We continue to see strong performance from our digital media optimization. Our return on ad spend in the quarter improved double-digits, led by campaigns like washable handbags and totes, which have resonated with customers as they are managing through the pandemic.
Earned media remained strong during the third quarter with over 3.3 billion impressions. We had exceptional media coverage of our mass effort supporting communities and healthcare workers, Breast Cancer Awareness Month and our foundation efforts and our brand collaborations and partnerships. We rolled out customer journey centered activations with high response rates, including a welcome journey for new Harry Potter customers and for mask purchasers new to our brand.
Vera Bradley has always been a brand about connecting with people and we continue to see best in the industry engagement rates on Facebook and Instagram. Our second launch with Crocs continued partnership with Disney in collaboration with Warner Brothers for Harry Potter gave our customers plenty to talk about in the quarter. This has helped our customers have a community to connect with in these difficult times and a way to find some fun and bright moments. This engagement has increased both followers and sales with third quarter revenue attributable to social media up triple-digits year-over-year.
Our store and wholesale teams continue to drive results through innovation and creativity. Although our digital business is becoming a larger portion of our revenues, both factory and full line stores continue to be an important part of our omni-channel strategy. We continue to focus on enhancing and reinventing the customer experience in both our full line and factory stores. While the pandemic and mandated capacity limits have challenged store traffic, we are using customer data to strengthen relationships by offering appointment shopping, particularly for our top customers, face time and social selling, buy online, pickup in store and curbside pickup where possible. Appointment selling was very successful generating nearly 10% of our full line revenues in the quarter.
Our loyal customer retention at the end of third quarter is actually better than it was at the same time last year. This is a testament to our new digital and data analytics programs, our customers' love for the brand and our associates' devotion to our customers. We have created more excitement in six Vera Bradley full line stores by adding Pura Vida shop-in shops after a successful test in Birmingham, Alabama. We will continue to leverage opportunities for both brands and we'll be rolling out a Vera Bradley plus Pura Vida Charity Bracelet program at Vera Bradley next year.
In the factory stores, we are testing line-busting technology in several high traffic locations, offering customers the opportunity to scan the QR code and receive a text message, what is their time to return to the store. They may also scan a QR code to review our electronic lookbook and decide what they would like to buy while waiting in line.
In the aggregate, our factory stores continue to outperform our full-line stores compared to last year as customers felt more comfortable shopping in outdoor centers than in closed malls. Our customer satisfaction scores are consistently industry-leading despite pandemic-related disruptions. We are striving to create a seamless shopping experience no matter where she chooses to shop. Our omni-channel customers are our most valuable, on average spending 3 times more than the single channel shoppers.
We have opened six new factory stores and expanded and renovated one factory store this year. We continue to focus on improving the productivity of our full-line stores. We have permanently closed seven full-line stores so far this year and expect to close five more by year end. This will bring our total full-line closings to 38 since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and we expect to close approximately 10 additional locations next year. On the wholesale side of the business, Amazon is our highest volume and fastest growing account. As Amazon continues to grow, we have put resources against this business to optimize our inventory assortments, assure pricing integrity and drive volume.
Now let's talk about Pura Vida. We remain excited about the potential of our Pura Vida brand. Pura Vida's year-over-year third quarter e-commerce revenues grew over 17% despite significant supply chain disruptions that impacted sales early in the quarter. As inventory normalized, e-commerce growth substantially accelerated in the back half of the quarter. Using Vera Bradley's global sourcing expertise, we have quickly strengthened Pura Vida's supply chain, diversifying raw material sourcing and adding three additional production facilities in countries outside of El Salvador. Of course, total revenues were also affected by sale to the wholesale channel, which are beginning to recover as specialty stores reopen and start to reorder. During the third quarter, we were able to divert some wholesale inventory into our e-commerce channel.
At Pura Vida, innovation in product is first and foremost. We continually introduce new styles of the Pura Vida signature cord bracelets and style packs and we have continued to add to our popular metal, mood and semiprecious collections, which are at a higher price point than our traditional string bracelets. This category expansion and product diversification is working.
In fact, nearly 50% of Pura Vida's e-commerce business in the third quarter was comprised of jewelry categories other than the traditional spring bracelets, underscoring the brand's lifestyle appeal. Pura Vida's fall launches were a success. Our celestial collection was a big winner, once again proving that beyond the beat styles resonate with our customers.
Earrings and necklaces continued in popularity as we further expanded our above-the-keyboard offerings for those not only living but working from home. Personalization is a continuing popular trend. Customers can personalize their signature cord bracelets by choosing the color combination or charm special to them. Our engravable collection launched earlier this year has taken off with customers loving the customization of bar necklaces, rings or coin bracelets. We have expanded the styles of engravable planks, including those embellished with birth stones or with zodiac signs. And we have added a thinner necklace where both sides can be customized with engraving.
Pura Vida signature charity bracelets will always be an integral part of the Pura Vida lifestyle and continue to be a growing category as they are so special to our loyal cost-minded customers. We are continually adding to our popular charity charm bracelets that we introduced earlier this year and to our charity style packs that support many amazing causes that are cherished by our customers. We developed two styles for Suicide Prevention Month in September and partnered with Boarding for Breast Cancer, selling four styles of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October. The expansion of the charm and style packs to our charity assortment is not only enabling us to increase our price points but to increase total donations to these great causes. To-date, Pura Vida has donated over $2.8 million to more than 200 charities.
For holiday, we have an expanded offering of gift sets and fun Advent calendars packed with 12 days of surprises. It's super sparkly style pack from one of our most well-known influencers, Aspen Haggard [Phonetic], our bigger collection of engravable jewelry and even more charms including zodiac and wildlife charity trails.
Pura Vida is continuing to expand on the distribution front. Earlier this year, we launched our Canada Shopify fulfillment capabilities and began wholesale distribution of our products in Europe to complement our existing e-commerce business and third-party fulfillment there. We already have many Pura Vida fans around the world and this global expansion is not only allowing us to serve those customers but extend our reach to others. Although we are early in our international expansion, we believe there are more opportunities ahead. Our first Pura Vida retail store that was scheduled to open this year was delayed due to the pandemic. We expect to open this exciting retail concept in San Diego next year. Pura Vida is truly expert in engaging customers, building loyalty and introducing new devotees into the Pura Vida lifestyle. Our monthly bracelet and jewelry clubs and Shore Club program are all creative ways to connect our customers with our products and lifestyle and cultivate loyalty.
During the quarter, earned media was strong with healthy returns and spend and Pura Vida doubled its SMS list from last year to 1.2 million active subscribers, which drove meaningful revenue. On the marketing front, Pura Vida's social media engagement is strong. Pura Vida remains one of the most highly engaged brands in the accessory space in social media with over 2 million Instagram followers. Pura Vida is consistently listed as one of the most, if not the most, engaged jewelry brands on Instagram. A lot of Pura Vida's marketing strategy and overall success is driven by its devoted group of brand ambassadors and close to 150,000 active micro influencers. These passionate advocates help us spread the Pura Vida movement showing their devotion to the brand while scoring perks along the way. These ambassadors and influencers create compelling and exciting content, create buzz about our product and share that excitement with their followers and fans. Like our holiday collaboration with Aspen Haggard [Phonetic], we have several more exciting influencer product launches lined up in the months ahead.
TikTok has taken off with 115,000 Pura Vida followers. TikTok feature influencers on bailing boxes showing sneak peaks of new items, promoting giveaways and giving tutorials. TikTok generates interest in followers with creative engaging content and drive sales by linking the Pura Vida online store and occasionally offering special promotional codes. Speaking of TikTok, we have moved the much anticipated launch of the Pura Vida bracelet influencer style pack with the reigning queen of TikTok, Charli D'Amelio, to spring 2021 due to production delays. We want to make sure we have enough product to execute and we are sure will be an incredibly successful launch.
Charli TikTok followers had grown by 20 million fans in just over three months to an astounding $100 million. And she has over 34 million Instagram followers. Her target demographic that's perfectly with the Pura Vida brand and we are thrilled with the upcoming partnership. We believe the strength of the Pura Vida business underscores the opportunity for discovering other small high growth potential brands like Pura Vida with unique product to marketing position that could become part of the Vera Bradley family brand.
Now more than ever, I am confident that we are in the right space with our purpose-driven casual, comfortable and fun lifestyle brands at both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida. Both brands have unique growth opportunities particularly as our focus is on customers who live beyond the major city centers and its customer base is growing as they migrate from big cities to smaller communities. We are positioned well for the future.
Operator, we will now open up the call to questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question, it comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Please go ahead, sir.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Thanks so much everybody. Appreciate it. So, the margins are really strong, but the direct was a little lighter than what we had modeled. What are you seeing in terms of the comp store sales and traffic trends and/or I'm sure there's a fair bit of volatility? And how has inventory trended in that channel relative to your expectations?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. Thanks, Oliver. From a traffic perspective, in the third quarter, we saw improvement obviously from the second quarter in both the factory and full-line channels. Factory was better than the full-line channel. So we saw better traffic getting to our stores as we opened up our stores, right, in earnest in the back half of third quarter. But from an inventory perspective, I think we're well positioned from an inventory perspective for both brands. We have -- outside of the beginning of this third quarter, Pura Vida got back into inventory late in the quarter and ultimately, I think, accelerated their sales [Phonetic] first part of the quarter was a little bit challenging from an inventory position perspective. In regards to stores at the Vera Bradley brand, we were well positioned in inventory for the full quarter.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Okay. And as we think about the comp and model the comp, what are some dynamics that you saw on conversion versus check size in the quarter that we just had? And any thoughts going forward? Will traffic continue to get better? Hopefully there's added visibility on the reopening.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. So, from a conversion perspective, conversion was definitely up in all channels whether that is e-commerce, whether that is the fashion, whether that is full-line because of individuals who came out to shopping, really came out to buy. So we saw conversion increase. We also saw kind of ADS, we the actual check go up. People were buying a little bit more but we actually also saw the AUR go down a little bit based on the fact that our mass square portion of the purchase at a $8 price point that's going to bring AUR down.
As we look into the fourth quarter, I think it's really -- it's going to be some challenges in the stores, it's going to be associated with capacity as all retailers kind of deal with the capacity constraints of certain states or certain cities in regards to what they're doing in regards to COVID-19. But the hope as we move into next year would be that the vaccine will allow kind of the stores and malls to open up to get traffic back to where we thought it would be as we entered into this year. But as you can imagine, factory stores from a traffic perspective, people still feel a little bit more comfortable going to kind of outside malls versus inside malls.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
And then, Pura Vida, all the details and strategy are helpful. I know you called out supply chain in wholesale as being factors. Could you elaborate on when those might have better visibility in terms of timing and improvement on those features of Pura Vida?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. So, from a supply chain perspective, we have corrected some of the challenges that we had. And Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks that we are now working with additional vendors to help kind of on the supply chain that we are not only can fully reliant on the El Salvador plant. From a wholesale perspective, we -- our stores opened up, as we look at this thing we think that's why we will see a correction from a wholesale perspective for Pura Vida.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Okay. And Rob, on product for fourth quarter and then next year, which products would you prioritize as most impactful to an outlook in terms of...
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
In terms of, I guess, what is -- are you specifically regarding Pura Vida or Vera Bradley about?
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Vera Bradley brand.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. Yeah, I think, with Vera Bradley, I think there's a lot of innovation coming. So, in fourth quarter, I think what becomes really important is, everything that we do around fleece and home and cozy, obviously it's really important in this time and year kind of all of our holiday patterns. But we're seeing now with hands-free being really important as we moved through the fourth quarter. We think that will continue into next year. And then, if we look at next year continuing with our collaboration we now believe which is really important and then continuing with our fabric innovation. And those are two things that become really important kind of across categories.
The thing that's been interesting is, if we've watched our youth travel and everyday business, we were expecting to see a lot more suppression in the travel business. And it's basically trended more similar to the rest of our business. So that's been encouraging to see because we're more in that soft travel, car travel category, which is held up better than kind of that hard luggage air travel. And so that's been encouraging to see. Back-to-school was difficult back in August, but we saw some strength coming in September. And obviously we're hopeful as we move through next year and get to back-to-school, but it will be in full return hopefully by the time we get to next fall.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Best regards. Happy holidays.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, Oliver.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Oliver.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Please go ahead.
Mark Altschwager -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the fourth quarter for a moment, and you mentioned that I think sales might not be as strong in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Understanding that the environment is tough to predict here, but it is something you could expand upon that a bit and you see that primarily conservatism related to store capacity. I guess with consumers focus shifting to gifting may be most of a headwind related to back-to-school.
I would think that continued sequential improvement, it might be possible. So maybe just talk a little bit more about the puts and takes there? And how you're thinking about holiday?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think that the holiday season, right? This holiday is definitely not like any other, right? I think what we have seen in retail in general and we have seen in our numbers is consumers move forward some of their spending. We had a very, very strong start to November. We were feeling very good. Obviously Black Friday, you can tell from all of the market reports, while there is suppression in store traffic as of Black Friday and so we will just watch and see how it plays out over December.
I think a couple of days in fourth quarter that are out there is that, as COVID started pulling back on capacity issues that caused a little bit of texture in some of our stores and in some of those capacity pullbacks had been pretty large and so that has been a pressure that we have seen in fourth quarter that we do not see as much in third quarter.
And then the second question just can become with the e-commerce as we move through the earlier shipping, right, and all of retail some of the businesses moved on e-comm and how that impacts that last week before Christmas will people get back out in the stores. There's just still a little bit of uncertainty out there and so we will watch how that works through.
And then the other thing just from an earnings standpoint, right, there are shipping surcharges and additional pressure in fourth quarter that we haven't had the rest of the year. So those are kind of the three key points, right? The reduction in capacity in stores, once the e-commerce shipping, deadline ship off what happens with the customer and third the surcharges, and so those are the things we are watching in fourth quarter that are unique.
But it's not that we think that there is an underlying weakness with the consumer or what we are seeing going on. We think the consumer is continuing to respond to novelty and innovation and so we see it just is kind of navigating through this COVID holiday and then moving into next year and hopefully next year momentum will continue to pick up.
Mark Altschwager -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst
Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then, on the marketing front, can you talk about how you are engaging with some of the new customers you have acquired with the mask sales over the last couple of quarters. Are they coming back to purchase other categories? I guess, what is that behavior looked like in terms of repeat business as the last couple of months have progressed?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. No. It's been very encouraging, both the new customers that we brought in through our mask business, as well as customers that we have brought into Harry Potter. We have very specific marketing journey to get to both of those customers to really engage them with the brand more deeply and widely. We have seen really good response from those customers in terms of coming back. So we are encouraged that we will be able to keep all those customers we have gained.
Mark Altschwager -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst
Got it. Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess, last one for me just bigger picture, Rob, you discussed this permanent shift in consumer behavior in a multi-year journey in terms of evolving what the store base looks like. But any changes to how you are thinking about that in the medium-term just in terms of stores versus digital? And for the outlook business specifically, isn't your approach evolving for online outlet relative to store outlet business, any high level thoughts there would be great? Thanks.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. In terms of overall, right, the journey we have kind of been on we have been -- we had talked about reducing hours full line store fleet, as you see we are projecting to continue to do that next year and we will watch in the mall development very closely to see what happens and in enclosed malls going forward.
On the outlet front store, we still feel that there's opportunity in the outlet channel. We have -- we are very happy with overall how the outlet channel has been performing, customers are coming back faster to the outlets and they are coming back to the enclosed malls. So we see that as an opportunity. We still are very cautious about moving the online outlet onto a digital platform just because of making that off priced product more highly accessible and so we still primarily see our factored business as a brick-and-mortar strategy.
Mark Altschwager -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much and best of luck.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, Mark.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mark.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Marotta of C.L. King and Associates. Please go ahead.
Steve Marotta -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst
Good morning, Rob and John. As far as the recent COVID hotspots and you mentioned, of course, it's negatively affecting capacity in the stores, is it having any effect on the e-commerce activity in those areas? In other words, you find that if people can't get in the stores e-commerce is going up or because of the restrictions and people not feeling very good about anything that sales are going down in those areas as well?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
I think that overall it's definitely not as quick as you slow downed the stores and then all passed on the e-commerce as they got e-commerce helps offset some of that, which I think we have seen in the industry and we've seen in our channels over this year. But as you -- as areas start to spike, we do see just consumers starting to pull back particularly for the first few weeks the things change, right, everybody I think begins to rebalance their life and we see a short-term impact. And then usually with time, those things begin to medicate.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And the only thing I would add to that -- to Mark's question a minute ago is, from the factory perspective when capacity goes down from a factory perspective, we don't have an outlet from an e-commerce perspective for those customers to buy.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah.
Steve Marotta -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst
Okay. I understand. And Rob, maybe you can provide a little bit of your outlook for fiscal '21, not obviously from a guidance standpoint but just from what you see as the trajectory of the consumer over the course of the year as the vaccine opens the economy back up again as specific guidelines are reduced, obviously it's going to be good for your business in some respect. Do you think there will be different styles that will be utilized? How do you best prepare and capitalize on the reopening and the timing of the reopening?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think, the first half of the year, right, it's definitely going to be continuing to navigate in a pretty dynamic environment. I think we're all hopeful that as we get summer, there's some normalcy starting to come back. And I think both brands are well positioned. If you think about what we expect to bounce back disproportionally would be things like summer travel. So that whole travel piece of business whether it's in our travel categories or Pura Vida with all their beach lifestyle and people getting back to beaches and getting out and doing all that. I think the second big one that we expect to really pop back strongly is back-to-school. And I think there's a lot of impacts from that. There's -- the Vera Bradley business in terms of the back-to-school business obviously this year, I think there's a lot of pent up demand. So we are hopeful there.
And secondly, Pura Vida, they do a lot of products around fundraisers and schools and teams and people come use their customizer pack to do fundraisers. And obviously this year, since a lot of that did not happen that business were softer. We think that that's a real opportunity to bounce back next year. So there could be a lot of positive momentum in the back half of next year as travel and school kind of pop back and return.
Steve Marotta -- C.L. King and Associates -- Analyst
That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is a follow-up question from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you. A few more just on the shipping and what you are seeing with the shipping deadlines. Is that then limiter to some of the revenue growth and/or as you look at elasticity as issues although you are taking the surcharge? I mean, has there been any consumer differences with cancellations and/or timing? And would also -- this is very hard to forecast, but as you look forward with mask, how are you thinking about planning inventories in that situation and that being a big part of the business currently? Thank you.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think, from the shipping deadlines, I think we've been managing through shipping deadlines capacity well. I'm sure you have seen some of the headlines out there that we were able to secure our capacity needs with UPS and we're managing through that. So we don't have any disproportionate delays here. We have actually been encouraged by how shipping and logistics piece has been working from just on time performance. That's not really the issue. There is the surcharge issue, which there is expense associated with that.
I think the bigger question is when the shipping cut-off happened and so much of the business has moved to e-commerce is what does the consumer do from that kind of shipping cut-off of approximately 12/15 through 12/25, right, that 10-day window as she go back out to store like she has traditionally or not. I think that's the big question mark as we move through the holiday.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And in regards to masks, right, I call the Aspen mask [Phonetic]. We do think masks are going to continue to base price as a percentage of total sales. We do -- we think they are going to be an important part of business for the fourth quarter and we think into the first quarter, but how it plays out after that, we are unsure.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Yeah.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Okay. And Rob, on Amazon, which you called out in the prepared remarks and pricing integrity, what are some of the key guardrails that you have there and what are the main benefits and opportunities that offset some of the risk factors of partnering and deepening the relationship with Amazon?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think, one, really building kind of a strategic partnership with Amazon was really important, with really dedicated resources people who really understood the channel. And we worked on making sure that we were pulling back on either counterfeit product that was available digitally out in the world and pulling that back to a lot of activities we've been doing there which helps with price stability, making sure that we're working with our other wholesale partners to make sure that they are maintaining price integrity.
And doing all of those things has really helped us manage the price integrity on Amazon. And I think it's just in this new world really being on top of data and management making quick decisions day in and day out has made that partnership effective.
The other thing that we've really used Amazon for is, key category penetration, right, there is so many people shopping on Amazon when people are looking for things like backpacks or masks or kind of category type of conversations. We want to be part of that search, part of the conversation and we can really pick-up new customers that way, which is the reason why we have really lean into it and we have been very happy with that partnership today.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Thank you. And finally, on the promotional environment, as you have been seeing it, how have you been seeing it and how has your merchandise margins been relative to your expectations? And what you're seeing in terms of being competitive relative to competitors as well?
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, with regards to merchandise margins, they are meeting really kind of our expectations. We haven't -- from a bureaucratic perspective, we haven't been significantly more promotional. In the third quarter, we are controlling the promotionality. As we look into the fourth quarter, we're just being -- we're looking at kind of what others are doing and they're trying to ensure that we play in the appropriate space. But as we have introduced kind of Vision 2020, we want to continue to drive full price selling versus kind of just revert back to kind of our time. So we are being thoughtful in kind of how we are promotional throughout the season. But we want to make sure that we don't leave any opportunity uncovered.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
And just finally, you've been a pioneer with using a lot of the data in AI for personalization and algorithms internally. What's the latest there in terms of like results that you've seen from implementing that technology in the organization?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think that what we've seen, one, is as we have seen a real acceleration of our consumer growth and kind of that 25 to 40-year-old category and a lot of that has been a very specific targeted marketing. We also think as we moving forward as we are continuing to diversify our customer base, really using a lot of very specific algorithms to really target consumers is really going to help us really talk to each one individually.
You can imagine that with our very diverse product portfolio from the color and style standpoint, there's a lot of regionality, there is a lot of specificity in terms of ages. And as we have been doing that, we have been seeing much higher returns on our ad spent and we think that with time we are going to continue get smarter and continue to get more and more targeted on our costs -- not only our product development but also on our marketing and what is available.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. As we brought in new customers from masks, got new role kind of Harry Potter, we have been able to get their repeat purchases that's better than average based on kind of specific earnings. So that's been helpful.
Oliver Chen -- Cowen -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Best regards.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, Oliver.

Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on Pura Vida. How you are speaking about the operating margins go forward in that business and also how you are thinking about planning it for 2021. And just to follow-up on the expenses, when you think about your fixed cost structure now versus pre-COVID, how much of the leverage do you see is impacting margins as the core business recover from COVID?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. From Pura Vida, we are still very excited about what the growth opportunity is in front of us with Pura Vida. A lot of initiatives are ahead of us. We think that from an operating margin, we believe that Pura Vida can continue to kind of begin at high-teens -- mid-to-high-teens operating margin. So we still feel very good about that business. From the expense standpoint, I'll let John touch some color on that one.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So from an expense perspective, we have a lot of fixed costs there. We saw some savings associated with certain items in the second and third quarter that we likely won't see kind of in the fourth quarter and some of those savings you can think of as our personal savings as we took some reductions in salaries or other furlough positions that we took. If you think about kind of core savings that we think we can see kind of into next year you can think of that as a discretionary savings and it's likely in the low single-digit as a percentage of total expense base that we think will be permanent savings on a go-forward basis.
Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Got it. And then, when you think about the partnerships like with Disney, what's coming up that we should be marking our calendars for?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
We haven't put the other launch date out there. But what I can tell you is that we have a very robust pipeline next year that is both with character releases, a lot of exciting news that's going to be coming. So we will continue to build on our partnerships with Disney, continue to build on our partnerships with Harry Potter and you will also be seeing that Pura Vida being taking advantage of a lot of licensing opportunities next year.
So those are the seven things we're doing on kind of the character licensing side. And additionally we are continuing to do collaboration work like we have done this year and we have some exciting things in mind next year. So stay tuned.
Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Got it. And just lastly any more learnings on the Project Novus side?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. I think, our big learnings there is just continuing to become more responsive and technology and data-driven. And then everything that we did around that project was so that we can move more rapidly. We can make changes more rapidly. We've seen in our prepared remarks you heard the comments, we will make about the improvements in SEO and how we just really are able to move quicker, right, with our new infrastructure platform more able to make changes and how we execute and what we learn in probably a matter of days versus what might have been months before and that will just over time we will get smarter and better and better.
I think that's one of the big things in this new world with technology and data. Now it's not a destination so to speak. It's kind of a journey, right? You keep getting better and better the more, the more you learn and you really build up a competitive advantage. And that's what we are working on.
Dana Telsey -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Thank you.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, Dana.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Beder of SCC Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
Good morning.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Good morning, Eric.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
Hi. During Q4, you've been a lot more aggressive in terms of apparel, and it's not the store -- in the Vera Bradley stores, but with outer wear, pajamas, robes, and I think the response has been pretty positive. Is that kind of a one-off holiday thing or should we be thinking about that as a potential category or some level of expansion going forward?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks for the question, Eric. Yeah, during fourth quarter, we definitely have expanded some of our apparel offerings really focusing on kind of key item areas. And we've been very, very happy with the response from the consumer. And we do think that's an area that you will see continued development. One thing that we have always believed in both of these brands is that both brands are truly lifestyle brands. It not just a product they are actually our lifestyle. So we think that there is opportunity to have category expansion in both brands.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
Okay. And speaking of that category, when you put a Pura Vida store-in-store at our Vera Bradley store, did you tell us how -- what kind of -- how big is this in terms of the physical store and what are they selling in there beyond, I guess, the core, are they selling the entire Pura Vida line. How does that worked right now?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. We're still -- we're working on all of the final design. We have identified a location. So, it is about an 800 square foot space. So it's kind of on the smaller store footprint, which we think is a great opportunity for Pura Vida. Within a jewelry store, you don't need as much space therefore you get a much higher sales per square foot to make it more profitable in the long run.
In terms of the assortment, it really is going to be focusing on kind of a fairly broad assortment. As you have seen the metal jewelry business continues to be exceptionally strong, so that would be a big part of the assortment supported by the string bracelet business, but also some of these other exciting initiatives they have planned for next year that we will be talking more about on the next call, some of the new initiatives we will be launching in the store too.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Eric, your question also in regards to the store and the store foot in the Vera Bradley stores or is it on specific to the Pura Vida new location?
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
I think what you described is Pura Vida new location.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
How big is the inside of Vera Bradley -- like Vera Bradley shop as far as I guess?
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think it's a shop-in shop in Vera Bradley. We are testing a few different things. So, we are testing in Birmingham. We gave a couple hundred square feet to Pura Vida and that was kind of a focused assortment on kind of their best-selling metal and string bracelets to kind of get a test up. We are rolling it out to additional stores and some of those presentations might be tighter.
One thing that's really great about Pura Vida is with the way they wall units work and how much product you can get in a very small square footage, you don't necessary need a lot of space. And so we are going to test a few different sizes, some of them might be 100 square feet, some of them might just be 12 linear speed of wall space, but it will be exciting to watch all that response. And then the charity bracelet program that will be in all of our stores will even be a tighter assortment, but we think it's a real opportunity.
What's been exciting is, we've seen a good response from our consumers, not only in the full-line stores but also in our factory stores buying full price product, whether it's been with Pura Vida or whether it's been in some of our collaborations that we tested by Harry Potter that we put in some of our factory stores. So we think there's a real opportunity to take advantage of some of this with all the traffic that's going to our factory stores.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
Okay. And finally, on ReActive, you have had open for almost a year, next month it will be a year approximately. What other -- I know it's been caught up unfortunately in the whole flow of everything else. But what kind of -- is it attracting the consumer you expected or are you expecting to be as aggressive with all the patterns of the pieces as you did in 2020? What do you expect to see ReActive kind of over the next, I guess, somewhat normalized year next year?
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yeah. We've been very happy with the ReActive performance, right? There were really two key elements of ReActive. One was really our first -- moving into sustainability. And the consumers really responded to that messaging. And we've seen the younger customer really be attracted to that messaging. You're going to see us. We have made a real commitment to moving our full-line assortments to a sustainable fabric platform as we move forward. So more exciting announcements next year, we think that's critically important and we've been very happy with the response.
The second piece of ReActive was just the more active lifestyle. And obviously, we've seen the consumer this year continue to get more casual, get more active. And I think we'll continue to be leaning in that and how do we use ReActive to even have a stronger foothold in the active space.
Eric Beder -- SCC Research -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. Good luck with the holiday -- rest of the holiday.
Robert Wallstrom -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Eric.
John Enwright -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

All earnings call transcripts","VRA earnings call for the period ending October 31, 2020."
2021-01-02,Law firms hired fewer partners from government positions this year. Here are 12 moves that made waves.,"If hiring a partner from another law firm is risky, hiring a lawyer working in the government is an even bigger risk: unlike an established partner with a Rolodex of clients and millions of dollars in business, a government hire is an unknown quantity who has to spend months reconnecting with old clients or building a book of business from scratch.
That doesn't stop top law firms from trying to lure government lawyers into private practice, especially if they are well-regarded and handled important matters during their time in public service. But the appetite among the top 200 US law firms to bring on government lawyers as partners fell in 2020: there were 78 such hires through December 28, compared with 125 in all of 2019, according to the legal-data provider Firm Prospects. 
The decline this year is in line with overall hiring trends: overall partner moves between law firms are down 27% from last year, according to Leopard Solutions, while associate moves are down 35%.
Read more: We talked to 18 legal headhunters to highlight the biggest rainmaker moves of 2020. Here's a rundown of must-know hires and exits, from M&amp;A and IPO pros to regulatory experts.
Many firms rehire lawyers after a stint of government work, like Bernard Nigro, who rejoined Fried Frank in October after working in the DOJ as the principal deputy assistant attorney general; Kelly Cleary, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services who rejoined Akin Gump in April; and Steve Peikin, who went back to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in September after working as co-director of enforcement at the SEC.
While there's a learning curve for all new law firm partners — it often takes bout three months for lawyers to start producing revenue — it can be even more challenging for government hires, many of whom join a firm with some industry connections but no formal client relationships.
Current government lawyers are also having a hard time landing a job in the private sector than lawyers associated with previous presidential administrations, Notes Andrew Regan, a recruiter at Empire Search Partners. He said in an email that fewer people have moved back through the revolving door because law firms are wearier about hiring people associated with President Trump. He said most of the high-profile moves during the last few years have been lawyers who were at odds with the Trump administration.
Despite the barriers, some government lawyers still found opportunities to transition to a new law firm. This list doesn't include partners who went back to their old firms, of which there were many, or moves to non-partnership roles. Here are 11 government hires that turned heads in 2020, based on name recognition, involvement in important matters, and conversations with six recruiters.
Geoffrey Berman, Fried Frank
Geoffrey Berman of Fried Frank. Berman is the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
Fried Frank
Berman led the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York from 2018 until June 2020, when he resigned after a public dispute with Attorney General William Barr. Berman, who had been a partner at Greenberg Traurig before he was named an interim US attorney in 2018, oversaw a slew of high-profile investigations and prosecutions, including Congressman Chris Collins, who pled guilty to insider trading and was recently pardoned by President Donald Trump, and Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, associates of Rudy Giuliani charged with campaign-finance crimes.
Berman was named in early December as the next leader of Fried Frank's white-collar practice. Audrey Strauss, his second-in-command at the Southern District who took the reins of the office upon his departure, is a former Fried Frank partner, and Berman was reportedly close with Steven Wirzel, another partner at the firm.
Jessie K. Liu, Skadden
Jessie Liu, a former US Attorney and partner at Skadden.
Skadden
Liu joined the Trump administration in 2017 as the deputy general counsel of the Treasury and served from late 2017 to February 2020 as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. A partner at Morrison &amp; Foerster before government, Liu was under consideration for an undersecretary role at the Treasury in 2017, but her nomination was reportedly scuttled over her role in prosecutions of the president's allies.
In September, Liu joined Skadden's Washington office, where she said she's been building a ""three-pronged practice"" around corporate white-collar defense, investigations and compliance advice; complex civil litigation, often with a government angle; and crisis management. She wouldn't mention specific cases, but she told Insider that ""government-facing civil litigation has actually been the busiest"" component of her practice since joining Skadden.
Other big hires in Skadden's Washington office in 2020 include Jeffrey Gerrish, who had been a partner at Skadden before taking a senior role with the US Trade Representative's office, where he worked on the negotiation of trade agreements with China, Japan, Mexico, and Canada.
Beau Buffier, Wilson Sonsini
An antitrust leader in both private practice and the public sector, Buffier joined Wilson Sonsini in November from the Biden campaign after several years atop the antitrust bureau of the New York Attorney General's office, which he joined in 2016. Before that, he had been a leader of Shearman &amp; Sterling's antitrust practice. 
Just weeks after his arrival at Wilson Sonsini was announced, Buffier filed an appearance on behalf of Plaid, the financial data company, in a lawsuit the Justice Department filed to prevent Visa from moving forward with its planned $5 billion acquisition of Plaid. Several other Wilson Sonsini lawyers are representing Google in its defense of a major antitrust case filed by the Justice Department.

James McDonald, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell
James McDonald, who led the CFTC's enforcement division and is set to join Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in early 2021.
James McDonald
In October, McDonald stepped down from his post as CFTC enforcement director, a position he had held since 2017. While at the commission, he focused on spoofing cases against banks and former traders. His work resulted in a record-setting $920 million settlement with JPMorgan for its role in manipulating the market while trading precious metals and Treasury securities.
McDonald is set to join Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's securities and commodities investigations and enforcement practice in early January. A first-time partner, he was also a litigation associate at elite DC firm Williams &amp; Connolly and an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York before joining the CFTC.
Legal recruiter Steve Nelson said law firm hires from the CFTC, especially for top positions, are always big deals, and Avery Ellis, managing director of recruiting firm Mestel &amp; Company, said McDonald's move was a ""terrific leap.""
Rod Rosenstein, King &amp; Spalding
Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Associated Press
Rosenstein needs no introduction. While the Attorney General is normally the public face of the Justice Department, Rosenstein, as the DOJ's second-in-command, shot to prominence early on, writing the memo that justified the firing of FBI Director James Comey and appointing Robert Mueller to investigate ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. A longtime prosecutor, Rosenstein left the DOJ in mid-2019 and officially joined King &amp; Spalding in January 2020.
Since joining K&amp;S's special matters and government investigations practice, Rosenstein has kept a low profile. He represents spyware company NSO Group in a case brought by WhatsApp that accuses the Israeli hacking company of deploying malware against WhatsApp users, and a K&amp;S spokeswoman said he has been defending against federal investigations. His bio on the law firm's website says he does a wide variety of work, from crisis management to tax disputes.
His time in the private sector hasn't been without controversy. Rosenstein and his firm became a target of protest after the New York Times reported that he ordered others at the DOJ to prosecute immigrant parents regardless of the age of their children, part of the Trump administration's family-separation policy.
Elizabeth Prelogar, Cooley
Elizabeth Prelogar, a former government appellate lawyer and partner at Cooley.
Cooley
An appellate star who served back-to-back clerkships with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, Elizabeth Prelogar joined Cooley in January after working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller and for the Solicitor General, who represents the government in the Supreme Court. Another Mueller lawyer, Andrew Goldstein, joined Cooley in 2019. Prelogar had been with the Department of Justice since 2014.
Since joining Cooley, Prelogar, who worked at Hogan Lovells before her time in government, has worked on a mix of business litigation and cases that could have big public policy impacts. She has been representing transgender student-athletes in a challenge to an Idaho law that banned them from sports and federal death-row inmates who sued the Justice Department over a surge in executions scheduled to take place until shortly before Joe Biden, who opposes the death penalty, is sworn in as president.
Businesses she has represented include Turo, a car-sharing company, in a case brought by Massachusetts regulators that has been appealed to the state's highest court, and Uber, which is trying to defeat an appeal lodged by taxi companies that sued Uber and lost at the lower-court level.
Prelogar told Insider Cooley has been focused on growing its white-collar and investigative capabilities on the East Coast, adding that she has been focused on growing its appellate and Supreme Court practice, including with the addition of several associates in 2020. 
Kelly Ann Shaw, Hogan Lovells
Shaw held a variety of positions in the White House related to international trade and economics before joining Hogan Lovells earlier this year. In her time as deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council, she worked on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the China Phase One agreement. She was also the US's ""sherpa,"" or lead negotiator, at the G7 and G20 forums.
Before her time in the White House, she was counsel to the influential tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and worked for the US Trade Representative. At Hogan Lovells, she works on both international trade and government relations matters. She said in an email that US-China tensions have impacted business decisions ""in nearly every sector,"" and said she has been able to tap her experience to help clients who have been ""thirsty for information about the inner workings of US and global governments.""
She is also a senior advisor at CSIS, a bipartisan think-tank, and she teaches a course on the history of US trade policy at Columbia Law School.
John Kucera and Lauren Bell, Boies Schiller
Kucera, a longtime prosecutor in Los Angeles, joined Boies Schiller after several years working on high-profile cases like the US government's case against Backpage for alleged facilitation of sex trafficking. He played a major role in one of the top international fraud cases of the decade, related to the theft of billions of dollars from the Malaysian government investment fund 1MDB.
Kucera's signature is on several complaints and other filings across more than a dozen lawsuits through which the Justice Department ultimately obtained more than $1 billion from Jho Low, his family members and affiliated companies.
Joining Boies Schiller around the same time was Lauren Bell, who has been acting chief of staff for the department's criminal division. During her time at the DOJ, she managed oversight of all 16 criminal divisions, handled press and policy issues, and supervised responses to congressional inquiries. Bell has also been senior counsel the criminal division's assistant attorney general; a trial attorney for the DOJ's public integrity section; and an assistant US attorney of the Northeast District of Ohio.
Kucera and Bell joined Boies Schiller as global investigations and white-collar defense partners, and their hire comes on the heels of another DOJ hire, Jesse Panuccio, who was brought on in 2019, and amid the departures of dozens of other of partners this year, including Nicholas Gravante, who had been named one of the firm's new managing partners just a year before, and other leading lawyers, like David Willingham, Karen Dunn, and Bill Isaacson.

Nasim Fussell, Holland &amp; Knight
As the former chief international trade counsel for the Senate Finance Committee, Fussell worked closely with Senator Chuck Grassley and the Trump administration on USMCA, the US-Japan Trade Agreement, and the China Phase One agreement. 
She's also worked at the House Ways and Means Committee and the Department of Commerce, and outside of government positions, she's worked at tech company Pitney Bowes and General Motors.
Fussell joined Holland &amp; Knight in September as a partner in the firm's international trade group.
Uzo Asonye, Davis Polk
Uzo Asonye, a partner at Davis Polk and former financial-crimes and corruption prosecutor.
Davis Polk
Asonye, who had been a senior financial crimes and corruption prosecutor at the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, joined Davis Polk in mid-November. He worked at O'Melveny &amp; Myers before joining government in 2010 and prosecuted a number of local and federal officials for corruption offenses. He also worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team and on one of two successful prosecutions of Paul Manafort, who managed the Trump campaign and was pardoned earlier this month.
Since moving to Davis Polk, where he is a partner in the white-collar defense and investigations group, Asonye said he has worked on Congressional investigations and has advised clients on a variety of other issues, including some related to the pandemic. He said the industry focus has been ""all over the map, from financial to tech,"" adding that he has been meeting firm clients and speaking to them about Davis Polk's trial capabilities.

The U.S. Justice Department had sued to stop the deal in November, saying that Visa was a ""a monopolist in online debit transactions"" and that the proposed acquisition ""would eliminate a nascent competitive threat"" to that monopoly.

The deal, which was proposed in January 2020, was scrapped to avoid protracted litigation, said Al Kelly, chairman and CEO of Visa Inc.
""We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaid's capabilities are complementary to Visa's, not competitive,"" he added.
Visa said in January it had agreed to buy the privately held startup Plaid in a US$5.3 billion deal aimed at boosting the payments giant's access to the booming financial technology sector.

2021-01-05,Man threatens to kill ex-boss for not accepting Facebook friend request,"A 29-year-old North Dakota man was arrested after he allegedly threatened to kill his former boss for not accepting his Facebook friend request. After sending his former boss a friend request, Burczyk began to send threats, including one that allegedly read: 'Accept my friend request or I'm going to murder you.' 
Caleb Burczyk from Williston, North Dakota, was charged with one count each of burglary and terrorising on December 29. Burczyk sent a Facebook friend request to his former employer on December 24, revealed Williston Herald citing court documents. 
Two days later, on December 26, Burczyk allegedly wrote that there would be trouble if he had to get in his pickup truck and track down his ex-boss. The message also included a picture of his truck. 
As per reports, Burczyk reached his former boss' residence and kicked his front door just after two days after sending the Facebook request. Burczyk had sent a friend request to his former boss on Christmas Eve. 
His boss, who is not named in charging documents, is listed Burczyk as a wireline operator at GR Energy Services, on his Facebook page. 
Authorities claimed that Burczyk used other social media platforms to make threats to the ex-boss. 
In one of the pic Burczyk posted to Snapchat, he was seen wearing a black cap, black vest and black plaid long-sleeve shirt, and had written that the ex-boss' family would need a new door, authorities said.

2020-12-17,5 Companies Owned by V,"Visa Inc. (V) is one of the most widely used and well-known digital payment companies, with service in more than 200 countries to consumers, merchants, governments, and major financial institutions. Visa offers authorization, clearing, and settlement services for merchants and institutions. A common misconception is that Visa issues credit cards. Instead, Visa makes its profits by selling services as a middleman between financial institutions and merchants. The company does not profit from the interest charged on Visa-branded card payments, which instead goes to the card-issuing financial institutions. While Visa does not issue credit or debit cards, the company does offer credit, debit, and prepaid card services to consumers and businesses.
Visa was founded in 1958 and has retained its core business model of facilitating payments between consumers and businesses. In the decades since its founding, however, Visa has dramatically expanded its reach. For FY 2020, ended September 30, the company reported $10.9 billion in net income on net revenue of $21.8 billion, with total payments volume of $8.8 trillion globally. As of December 17, Visa has a market capitalization of $494.3 billion.
In recent years, the company has taken an active approach to growing organically and by acquisition, including by buying companies with advanced payment technologies. Several of Visas top acquisitions have allowed the company to enter new businesses, including fund transfers between bank accounts, and also mobile banking and payment integration. Other acquisitions have helped the company to consolidate or improve its existing businesses.
Below, we look in detail at 5 of Visas most important acquisitions. The company does not provide a breakdown of how much profit or revenue each acquisition currently contributes.
<ul><li>Type of Business: Fintech</li><li>Acquisition Price: $5.3 billion</li><li>Date Purchased: January 13, 2020 (Announced)</li></ul>
Founded in 2013, Plaid is a fintech company providing technology that makes it easy for consumers to securely connect to thousands of financial apps such as Chime, Acorns, Betterment and Venmo. Visas purchase of the company, announced in January 2020 and pending approval from regulators, represents both an expansion into new lines of business as well as an enhancement of Visas existing offerings. Visa noted the acquisitions potential for expanding its market reach, as well as strengthening its relationship with fintech partners and their developers. Notably, the acquisition price of $5.3 billion is about double Plaids valuation before the deal, reflecting Visas commitment to expanding into fintech before rivals become a significant threat. On November 5, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust suit aiming to block Visa's acquisition of Plaid.

Prior to 2016, Visas business in Europe, including more than 500 million Visa-branded credit cards issued in the region, was controlled by Visa Europe. Visa Europe operated as a separate business and was owned and operated by member banks and other payments services companies. In September 2015, Visa announced plans to acquire Visa Europe to consolidate operations into a single global company. The transaction included an upfront consideration of 16.5 billion and a total transaction value of up to 21.2 billion based on an additional potential payment to be made after the fourth anniversary of the close of the deal. Besides consolidating Visas operations, the acquisition expanded its electronic payments volume across Europe. At the time of the acquisition, 37% of personal spending in the region took place via cash or check.

Verifi is a payment services technology company that reduces chargebacks, which are charges returned to a credit card after a customer successfully disputes them. Verifis technology allows for speedy resolution of these disputes, reducing costs and time for consumers and merchants. Visa purchased Verifi to integrate its technology into Visas existing risk management services. Chargebacks account for tens of billions of dollars in losses annually for payment providers and merchants. Visa expects the adoption of Verifis technologies to cut its own losses significantly.
<ul><li>Type of Business: Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network</li><li>Acquisition Price: $257 million</li><li>Date Purchased: May 8, 2019</li></ul>
U.K.-based Earthport specializes in cross-border payment services and one of the worlds largest independent automated clearing house networks at the time of Visas acquisition in 2019. Before the acquisition, Visa enabled payments to be sent only to or from Visa cards. Buying Earthport made it possible for Visas clients to allow governments, businesses and individuals to use Visa to send or receive money through bank accounts worldwide. The deal will enable Visa to reach most of the worlds banking population and allow them to easily, quickly, and securely move money worldwide. Trillions of dollars is sent via a wire transfer or bank account globally.

Payworks is a German company that develops cloud-based software to integrate payments for retailers into a single omnichannel offering. This enables a seamless shopping experience whether consumers are shopping online from a desktop, by telephone, on a mobile device, or visiting a physical store. Visa acquired Payworks in July of 2019 with the intention of integrating Payworks point of sale (POS) technology with its CyberSource payments management and fraud protection platform.","Plaid, Visa Europe, Verifi, Earthport, and Payworks are major companies owned by Visa."
2021-01-13,Venture capitalists react to Visa-Plaid deal meltdown,"Congratulations, you’re no longer selling your company for billions of dollars!
As strange as it sounds, that’s the leading perspective from venture capitalists concerning Plaid, now that its much-touted sale to Visa has fallen apart.
The $5.3 billion deal would have seen banking API startup Plaid join consumer payments and credit giant Visa. But the American government took a dim view of the deal, and according to Axios reporting, Plaid felt like it could be worth more money in time.
The TechCrunch team has collected views from venture capitalists, analysts and Anshu Sharma, CEO of another API-powered startup and a former VC to get a better view on the perspectives in the market concerning the blockbuster breakup.
From the venture capital side of things, most takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid’s chances now that it’s no longer being taken over by Visa. Amy Cheetham, for example, of Costanoa Ventures, said that the result is “good for the company, ultimately.” She added that Plaid may now see better “talent acquisition,” faster product decisions and a better eventual valuation.
“There is so much left for them to build in fintech infrastructure,” Cheetham said in an email, adding that she sees “Stripe-like scale potential” in Plaid. Stripe is reportedly raising capital at a valuation that could reach $100 billion.
Cheetham is not alone in her bullish perspective. Nico Berandi of Animo Ventures wrote to TechCrunch to say that he “still wishes” that his firm had been “around back then to have invested” in Plaid, adding a smiley face at the end of his missive.",Most of the takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid's chances now that it's no longer being acquired.
2021-01-01,What’s in Preston’s Wardrobe? – Closet Tour & Menswear Evaluation (Part 1),"Building a classic menswear collection is an ongoing journey–and today, I’ll walk you through my wardrobe, show you the purchases I’ve made to build it, and discuss some gaps I’d like to fill!
Today, I’ll give you some insight into where my wardrobe stands currently (as of the filming of this video in the fall of 2020), and what I like and dislike about it. By the way, stay tuned for Part II, where I’ll dive more specifically into my collection of accessories, coming soon!
Preston’s Closet Tour (Transcript Lightly Edited) 
This is most of the full scope of the closet. Obviously, I take up roughly half of the real estate here; the other half belongs to my wife. Space-saving hangers certainly do come in handy for me here in our humble apartment. A special thanks to my friend, Tim, for gifting them to me!
Preston is also a baseball fan.
Minnesota Twins Jersey
The first item I suppose I could mention, because I do keep it in my closet, is a Minnesota Twins jersey. Of course, I am a baseball fan and not absolutely everything in my wardrobe is classic menswear-inspired!
Jackets
Moving on to jackets – we’ll start first with odd jackets – we’ve got this piece, which is louder and bolder in almost kind of a madras-like pattern or at least a plaid overall. But I do like the color scheme and like to have something a bit bolder as an option in my wardrobe. 
Next up is one you’ve seen many times. This is a camel hair sport coat – a vintage model. In fact, it’s got the football style buttons as you can see here. I am a big fan of this one and wear it quite often; as is also the case with my double-breasted navy blazer. This is a vintage model that I found secondhand, as well. And this is another one of my favorites.
Preston’s camel hair sport coat.
Obviously, it’s got contrasting buttons, which makes it a blazer. If you’d like to learn more about blazers, you can find our video on the differences between those sport coats and suit jackets here.
Next up, another sport coat you’ve seen quite often. This one in a kind of a charcoal color with a herringbone pattern. I’ve had this one for quite some time, but I do quite like it.
Preston’s charcoal herringbone sport coat.
Here is another vintage second-hand model. This one in kind of a more bold blue color. You can see it’s only selectively lined here. So I will wear it commonly in the summer, and I do appreciate the slight knobbiness of the weave in certain areas here. And it’s just a bold and distinctive color so, again, I enjoy wearing this one in less formal settings.
And another herringbone jacket; this one in linen. I’ve only had this one for a few years, but it’s become one of my fast favorites and, of course, you’ve seen it in several posts and videos.
Full Suits
I also have full suits in the closet. So I will start with this one. This is a two-piece in not quite a navy blue, perhaps more of a medium or even a royal blue.
Next up here is the black suit obviously one you don’t see very often. Again, black – not a terribly versatile color. We’ve got a guide on whether or not you should wear a black suit, and how often you can, which is something you might enjoy.
I’ve also got a brown patterned suit. It’s another two-piece, of course, and it is a vintage model. But, I do appreciate the dark, kind of charcoal brown color, and, obviously, subtle pinstriping. I also find it quite nice.
Next is a newer acquisition from Suit Supply, as you might be able to see on the hanger there or on the inside of the jacket here with this nice bold lining. And you can learn whether or not we think Suit Supply suits are actually worth it or not in our Suitsupply Review post.
Preston’s newly acquired navy suit from Suitsupply.
Finally here, for suits, we’ve got a charcoal model with kind of a subtle pattern and texture in the weave. This one is the sole three-piece suit in my collection with a waistcoat here, as well.
Wardrobe Gaps
As far as gaps In this part of my wardrobe are concerned, I think I would like to add some more full suits to my collection – single and double-breasted styles, two-piece and three-piece, probably some incorporating more patterns. Most of my suits are solids, so, I would like to add some of those, perhaps a medium gray suit that fits well would be one that I would like to acquire.
Preston hopes to fill his wardrobe gap with pieces that fit and complements his style (…but probably not this very 1970s suit!)
As far as the odd jackets are concerned, I feel that you can never really have too many of those. 
Shirts
I have a white ground with a microgrid pattern in a light blue and green, a simple blue and white striped model, a Prince of Wales check in blue and yellow over white. Also, I have a plain blue, a blue gingham pattern on a white background. I’ve had many of these in my wardrobe for several years. Some of them, almost 10 years at this point.
Warmer hues shirts are organized here. I have one in a plain pink pastel, of course; another micro-check pattern in red and blue on a white background. I have one in a purple color that I believe Tira calls lilac.
Preston’s patterned dress shirts.
This one again, here, in a glen check in a more traditional kind of cooler purple color. I also have one in pink and blue, again, on a white background. And you will note, as well, that most of my shirts again happen to be French cuff models. I quite like French cuffs and cufflinks, but more on cufflinks when we talk about accessories.
Next up here, a microgrid in green kind of lime green on a white background. Here. another twill weave shirt – this one in a yellow pastel. I have another one with a micro-check in blue and yellow on a white ground; another check pattern. This one I like because it’s got several colors in it. There is orange, there’s purple, there’s green, and there’s blue. And here we’ve got my plain green shirt.
Preston’s pink pastel dress shirt.
Next up here, another check in a darker blue and kind of a magenta color. This one, another of my oldest dress shirts. I believe it is from Calvin Klein, and it’s another micro-check, of course. You can see I’m quite fond of those because they are versatile; they have character without being too flashy, for the most part.
Most of Preston’s shirts have French cuffs.
This one, of course, is in light blue and black on a white ground. Here, we’ve got a finer stripe in gray and white, and this one is in ecru or off-white.
I’ve just got a collection of white shirts. I’ve got a few spread collar models here. Although, I really don’t have too many spread collar shirts in my wardrobe.
Short-Sleeved Shirts
As we continue moving through the racks here, we’ve got short sleeve button-ups for more casual ensembles in warm weather. Summer is a more casual season. In a lot of circumstances, overall, I find that these short sleeve button-ups are good for those kinds of casual ensembles. 
You would usually see Preston in his short-sleeved shirts during the summer season.
And here, we’ve got my selection of short-sleeve button-ups from Charles Tyrwhitt. These also have button-down collars, which again reinforce that they are, indeed, casual shirts.
Polo Shirts
Still in the realm of short sleeves, but we’re moving on now to polo shirts. This one, one of my favorites. I’ve had it for many years and I like it quite a bit. In a navy blue color with a textured kind of weave that gives a sort of striped feel. 
This empty hanger here is for the shirt that I’m currently wearing. You’ve seen this one in videos elsewhere in the channel; in kind of a grayish-blue color with variegated white stripes. This one, is in fact, from Polo in a navy color, as well, and kind of a thicker coarser weave.
Preston’s polo shirts.
Here’s one more turret model. This one is a flannel in kind of a dark magenta, sort of a jewel-toned color with accents in gray and blue. And you can find our video on how to wear flannels here and here. Of course, these are not shirts at all but my odd waistcoats, which I wear on occasion with my jackets. This one is in navy blue with a subtle lighter blue overcheck.
I have one in a micro-check of sort of brown and blue tones that are very subtle. And this one – in plain black. Although, again, I don’t wear it terribly often because it isn’t too versatile. So, that rounds out the shirts in my wardrobe.
Trousers
We’ll start here with my white pair of trousers. These are from Brooks Brothers, as you can see by the hanger here. I don’t believe I’ve actually worn these in any videos for the channel, as yet. Although, you have seen them, given that I did wear them as part of the sort of club formal look that I wore for my wedding ceremony. You’ll find that almost all of my trousers are plain. I find that it helps to ground outfits in a very simple way, especially when my shirts are incorporating more patterns.
Most of Preston’s trousers are plain and in solid color.
So, we’ve got, for example, a khaki color here, charcoal gray, a medium to a slightly lighter brown. Here’s a black pair, one of a few. This pair, slightly more unique, in sort of a gunmetal blue-gray, perhaps you might call it. This pair is one of the few patterned pairs in my wardrobe, although the pattern is very, very subtle. Here’s another black pair. This is actually the oldest, uh, pair of trousers that I still have in my wardrobe.
Preston wore these white trousers at his wedding.
Here, we’ve got a navy blue, another black pair, a bolder medium blue, another brown pair. These have a bit of a warmer tone than the other brown pair. 
And here we’ve got another sort of khaki color, although this is a bit more in the stone range, and this empty hanger here is for the pair that I’m currently wearing in kind of a taupe shade somewhere between gray and brown. So, they can work in either family and they’re versatile in that regard.
As far as gaps in my wardrobe, I feel that I do have a fairly solid collection of trousers here. Although, I’m always on the lookout for more pairs. I might incorporate some more patterns, as well, in the future. And as far as shirts are concerned, again, I feel that I’ve built up a fairly solid wardrobe here. Though, I’m also always on the lookout for new shirts, as well. 
In particular, you’ll notice that, although I do have many colors here, I don’t have any shirts in an orange shade. So, that’s one that I’ll be on the lookout for, and I would like to get more casual options and more polos in the future, as well.
Sleepwear
My bedside seemed like a perfect place to give you a brief look at the few sleepwear options that I do have that fall into the realm of classic menswear. We’ve got here a matching set of pajama shirt and pajama pants. Also part of that set, actually, was this robe; as a matter of fact, too, in kind of a navy blue color fairly simple there.
Sleepwear options – pajama sets, robes, moccasin slippers.
This is an old pair of slippers, kind of a moccasin style that I’ve had for many, many years and kept around. I’d like to get a more formal style at some point, but just for the sole functional purpose of keeping my feet warm, they do their job and they’re not terribly bold or flashy in how they look. And here, of course, is my vintage dressing gown in kind of a burgundy red color featuring some fairly bold accents.
You’ve seen this, I believe, briefly in our vintage buying video, as well as in the interior design classics video.
Shorts and Undershirts
Believe it or not, I do have a small collection of shorts, although you probably won’t see them in a video anytime soon. I’m not a frequent wearer of shorts by any means; not even in warm weather. Although, I do have a few pairs and here, of course, undershirts in white but also in gray to more closely match my skin tone; to be worn under dress shirts that are particularly thin. Having shirts in a different color than plain white can sometimes be a smart choice. 
Preston’s shorts and undershirts go in the drawer.
Casual Trousers
In this drawer, we’ve got more casual trouser options like denim jeans, of course, as well as things like corduroys for when casual pants are the order of the day.
Sweaters
I also have a collection of sweaters, most of which you have seen on the channel in some form. Things like plain blue, blue, and brown in a pattern. Here, this more rustic brown model.
This one – brand new to my collection. Haven’t even removed the tags yet again from Hawes &amp; Curtis. Stay tuned to see if we produce a video on them. Here, my wine colored cardigan from Charles Tyrwhitt, one of my favorites. This one – in a berry purple color.
Preston’s new sweaters from Hawes &amp; Curtis.
These particularly soft sweaters, I could fold but they’re decently well-spaced in this drawer, so I never really have too many issues. A bit of a spritz with vodka can usually take wrinkles out.
This one in plain black. Here, a sweater vest in light gray and this one, a quarter zip in an oatmeal color that you’ve seen a time or two on the channel.
Under Things, Athletic Wear &amp; Swimwear
And down here in the bottom drawer, mostly what I’ve got down here is extras of underthings, pajama socks.
Preston’s underthings, swimwear, etc. is in the bottom drawer.
Here is where I mentioned you can find a bit of athletic wear, as well as some swim trunks of various different types. But that about covers the dresser. All right.
Large Hall Closet
So, now we’ve moved from the bedroom to the large hall closet, which contains the remainder of my wardrobe. So, up here on the top shelf, unglamorous but you can see I’ve got a couple of boxes. This is where I keep all my shoe polish, shoe brushes, shoe care, shoelaces, shoe bags. All of that, perhaps, a subject for a future video. We definitely plan to do more with shoe care in the future.
But, moving on here to what we’ve got in the closet.  This is a piece I wear quite often. Standard navy blue Harrington jacket from Polo Ralph Lauren, one of the staples in my wardrobe. And we’ve got a couple of garment bags here, of course, from various places. This one from Suit Supply, I believe. That one more heavy-duty, of course. 
Preston’s navy blue Harrington jacket from Polo Ralph Lauren.
Moving on, these three pieces, again, are brand new acquisitions at the time we’re originally recording this video. These from Hawes &amp; Curtis. Here’s my overcoat area. This one in navy blue. This one in plain black. And you can see a pair of Fort Belvedere gray gloves in that pocket. I’ve kept them in there. We, of course, have a relatively wide selection of glove styles, as well. So, be sure to check out the Fort Belvedere shop for that.
This one, a vintage military overcoat. You can tell, of course, from the buttons, as well, there. I may get the buttons replaced if I choose to wear the coat just for its color. I certainly wouldn’t want to be accused of stolen valor or anything of that nature.
Preston’s vintage military overcoat.
Here is my collection of scarves. I won’t go over these terribly in-depth, but you can see this one in kind of grays and browns, another gray model, some burgundy red, blue. This green one, knitted for me by a friend.
This one in a check pattern, again, in browns and grays. Here, in what might be called a macro herringbone pattern, perhaps. Uh, here’s a more standard herringbone in gray, and, I believe, that about covers the scarves, at this moment. I would, of course, like to get some Fort Belvedere scarves into my wardrobe, as well. Here, a shorter overcoat-style. 
Preston’s collection of scarves
This one in a charcoal gray color, and this one, perhaps, my favorite a vintage camel hair coat that I picked up from a small local shop. But I quite like that one, and we’ve got various other pairs of Fort Belvedere and other gloves here in the pocket, and these burgundy ones are touch screen compatible gloves. So, quite handy there. Let’s do a bit of reconfiguring here, and then I can show you some of the other elements, like Black Tie and a few pieces I don’t wear terribly often.
Formal Wear
Next up here, we’ve got formal wear, and then also pieces in my collection that, for one reason or another, I don’t wear terribly often. So here, of course, a standard pleated front tuxedo shirt, which you have seen a number of times on the channel before. A pair of Black Tie trousers with the single gallon or braid along the side here in black.
Two ivory dinner jackets, both featuring shawl collars. This one – single-breasted and this one – double-breasted, a more recent acquisition. A vintage model originally from Sam’s Tailor in Hong Kong. You can also see the sleeve style here.
Preston wearing his ivory dinner jacket. (accessories from Fort Belvedere)
Another pair of Black Tie trousers with a grosgrain braid, but these are actually unhemmed. I have not worn them, but I keep them on standby here.
We have a variety of different White Tie and Black Tie jackets, as well. This one – a vintage shawl-collared tailcoat, which was given to me by a friend of mine. In fact, it was maestro Andrew Casey with whom I’ve collaborated on a few concerts and different things. You can learn more about him in my concert video.
Preston in his black tie ensemble. (black tie accessories from Fort Belvedere)
Here is one of my vintage Black Tie tuxedo jackets – double-breasted here. Although, you can see that it is in need of a bit of steaming and ironing, and I, perhaps, will even have to do some restoration work on these lapels. That one in midnight blue, as is this vintage tailcoat. You can see the vintage, almost kind of grosgrain-inspired buttons here. Next up is another tuxedo jacket. This one, again, in black with a peak lapel and single-breasted in style.
Other Pieces
Here then are pieces that I still have in my wardrobe, but that I don’t wear terribly often. This again is a medium to light gray suit and that was included in my things I regret buying video because it is a very cheap quality, but I don’t wear it because it doesn’t fit me very well nor does this houndstooth sport coat, which you have seen before but again is fairly large on me, so I don’t regularly wear it. I would like to get a sport coat in a houndstooth pattern that fits me better than this one does.
This jacket you’ve seen a few times before. Again, kind of boxy on me. I will wear it from time to time. I do like the pattern, but again, I would like to get something similar that fits me better. This jacket fits me fine. It’s a vintage model, obviously, in green. A single-breasted blazer with contrasting buttons. Fits me well, but is so bold that I just don’t wear it very often. I will on occasion. This jacket, also a bit boxy on me, in shades of blue and brown but could be tailored a little bit to fit me well. I think it’s at least roughly within my wheelhouse.
Some of the pieces that Preston doesn’t wear quite often – like this herringbone sport coat.
This is a waistcoat, uh, that does not have any sort of size adjuster on the back so is a little large on me. And finally, here, you have also seen this jacket in a bird’s eye weave in a few various other videos; also a little boxy on me, and the sleeves are a bit short, as well. But, I think with some tailoring, I could get this jacket to fit eventually.
Shoes
I have excavated my shoe rack from the closet. We can actually start with the pair I’m wearing here. These are tobacco brown suede loafers from Scarosso, a favorite pair of mine.
So starting in on my shoes, we’ll just work from the top down. We’ve got here a pair of cap-toed, black derby shoes. I’ve had these for almost close to 10 years now, I think, and they’re definitely starting to show their age a little bit.
Cap-toed black derby shoes.
We have here a pair of single monk straps in black. These were covered as part of our shoe series. Here we’ve got a pair of Allen Edmonds loafers in black. These do also have rubber soles, but given that they are Allen Edmonds shoes they can be resoled when the time comes for that to happen.
And here on the end, we have a pair of dark brown, sort of chocolate brown, uh, suede loafers. I quite enjoy those, as well. Here is another pair of Allen Edmonds. These in sort of a woven leather design in a medium brown; good as a summer shoe. You’ve seen these shoes a few times on the channel, especially in my early days when I first started with the Gentleman’s Gazette and hadn’t really built up much of a shoe collection yet. 
Single monk straps in black.
Obviously, as you can see, rubber-soled shoes and quite thick rubber-soled shoes at that. This here, a pair from Moral Code. You see I’ve got shoe trees in them right now. Also covered in our shoe series, they are derby’s with broguing, but no medallion on the toe, which is interesting; makes them slightly unique in that regard, I suppose. Another pair of Allen Edmonds. These are Park Avenues, I believe, in a brown color.
If I work in a zigzag pattern here, these shoes from Undandy, are in kind of a chocolate brown suede with contrasting laces. The laces are actually from Fort Belvedere, and you can find many different colors of laces in our shop. Here, we’ve got a pair of wholecuts from Ace Marks. I like these shoes quite a bit. In addition to how they look, I very much appreciate that hand-painted patina. They are excellently comfortable shoes. I absolutely love wearing them, and they never give me any trouble.
Wholecut oxfords from Ace Marks.
Here is another Allen Edmonds, of course, this a traditional penny loafer-style in kind of a dark oxblood color. Of course, to almost all of my shoes, I have had rubber half soles or soul savers put on. I’ve got poor balance due to a physical disability, so I will often augment my shoes with various things.
These rubber half soles, I’ll often put in insoles to control sweat and moisture as I do also have a condition called hyperhidrosis. And, occasionally, these tongue pads, as well, to get shoes to fit better. So all of those different devices can help me with my footwear, to get things to fit me better.
Penny loafer-style shoes in oxblood color from Allen Edmonds.
Here, we’ve got a pair of gray suede derbies. This from the brand Heinrich Dinkelacker and they feature Johann Rendenbach soles. Here, a pair of Sperry Top-Sider – perhaps the classic boat shoe. And you can learn more about boat shoes in other videos we have produced. 
This, certainly, is a bolder shoe from a, basically, a fashion outlet called Strange Island. We again reviewed them as part of our shoe series. And here, a pair of brown and white spectator shoes. Again, wingtips. These are cheaper shoes. I found them on relatively short notice because I wanted to wear a spectator style for my wedding, and given that it was just as we were getting into the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic, my options for purchasing were a bit limited.
Preston wore these spectator shoes at his wedding.
In addition to all of those, I will also highlight here a pair of rubber overshoes. These come in very handy in wet weather and also in the winter months. Here, we’ve also got a pair of dark leather, again, kind of an oxblood color of some dress boots made by a company called Parkhurst. I don’t wear these terribly often as I’m not much of a boot guy, generally.
And then, of course, that brings us to my final pair – my vintage pair of Allen Edmonds opera pumps. You can see that I should perhaps re-dye the bows at some point on these, but these have served me well when wearing various Black Tie ensembles over the years. I’ve also now had rubber half soles put on these.
Preston’s opera pumps from Allen Edmonds.
In addition to the shoes that I showed on the shoe rack here, there are a few other pairs in my collection as well. There are a pair of burgundy oxfords from Beckett Simonon and a pair of tan derby shoes with a bit of broguing from Allen Edmonds that I didn’t show today because they’re currently undergoing a bit of restoration and repair.
Another two pairs that you didn’t see were a pair of green suede loafers from Loake and a pair of moccasin-style loafers from Velasca, both of which aren’t in my regular rotation because they are a bit too big on me, even with modification.
Wingtip oxfords from Taft.
Rounding out this group of shoes that you didn’t see would be a pair of wingtip oxfords from Taft, which I’ve decided to use as an experimental pair to see how I can do different types of shoe polishing techniques, and a brand new pair at this time of black oxfords from Carmina. 
And, as far as shoes are concerned, you can see that I have several styles already and perhaps my biggest issue is that I’m currently running out of space. But, certainly, I would always welcome other shoe styles in my wardrobe. So, stay tuned for more shoe content.
Additional Wardrobe Gaps
I would also perhaps like to get a few other overcoats in the future, and as I said, more odd jacket styles, which we also covered earlier. But with that said, that basically covers my whole wardrobe as it stands currently. So, let’s head back to the studio and I’ll give you a few closing words there.
Preston’s wardrobe.
Conclusion
I hope you enjoyed this look at the current state of my wardrobe and a peek at my apartment. As I alluded to with the pieces from Hawes and Curtis, my wardrobe does continue to change and evolve over time which, in essence, is one of the broader themes of this video.
So, whether you’re just starting out on your sartorial journey or you’ve got a well-stocked collection that you know like the back of your hand, chances are that there’s always room for at least one new piece or for a new combination of pieces that you hadn’t considered before.
And if it’s been a while since you’ve done a thorough evaluation of your own wardrobe like I did today’s, we’d suggest that you do so. You may find garments that you’d like to toss, repair, or donate or you might just come up with some new ideas for how to put your wardrobe elements together.

2021-01-13,Payments start-up Rapyd doubles valuation to $2.5 billion as Covid turbocharges growth,"A credit card pictured on a computer keyboard.
LONDON ""Every company will be a fintech company,"" Angela Strange, a general partner at famed Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz, declared early last year.
Her comments reverberated through the fast-growing financial technology industry, and came as tech giants like Google and Applesignaled a growing interest in banking. 
Can any big brand embed finance into their services? Rapyd, a firm providing what's sometimes referred to as the ""plumbing"" of fintech services, thinks so.
""We believe that every single company that is a consumer-facing brand will end up as a fintech company, because the main way to monetize your client base is with financial services,"" Arik Shtilman, Rapyd's co-founder and CEO told CNBC.
Shtilman's company announced on Wednesday that it had raised $300 million in a mega funding deal, lifting its valuation to $2.5 billion. That's more than double the $1.2 billion Rapyd was worth in a 2019 funding round.
What is Rapyd?
Rapyd describes itself as a ""fintech-as-a-service"" platform. The company's technology lets firms integrate a range of payment methods into their apps, including money collection, bank transfers, digital wallets and card issuing.
It's seen massive demand thanks to a boom in the online payments industry, fueled in no small part by the coronavirus pandemic. Shtilman says Rapyd now has 5,000 clients in total, though he didn't comment on any specific names.
Rapyd now has an annual run rate of $100 million, Shtilman added. This is a key metric used by companies to determine how much money they could make in a full year. It's grown from just 25 employees in 2018 to over 200 today.
The company actually began life as a mobile payments service for consumers. Facing regulatory constraints, Rapyd later pivoted to a ""white label"" model where it would license its technology to other companies instead. Shtilman calls it a white-labeled version of PayPal.
Rapyd's latest funding round, a Series D, was led by tech-focused investment manager Coatue, which has previously backed food delivery firm DoorDash and TikTok owner ByteDance. Venture capital firms Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs, and Latitude also bought new shares.
""We were not really fundraising originally,"" Shtilman said. ""We were very well financed already. We got approached by a lot of investors, especially big names, who wanted to invest in the company.""
""At a certain stage, we saw the business was exploding. It was a great time to pull the trigger on the round.""
Consolidation
With an extra $300 million in the bank, the company says it's on the hunt for fresh acquisitions to help it expand in a number of key markets like Brazil and countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
In a sector worth $2 trillion, Rapyd is up against some serious competition. The company's rivals range from incumbent players like PayPal to younger firms such as Stripe, Adyen and Checkout.com. Stripe is itself an investor in Rapyd.
""There is a lot of competition,"" Shtilman said. ""You need to also understand we are a bit different to most of the companies in the space.""
""A lot of the companies are payment processors,"" he added. ""We are a financial services provider.""
The payments sector has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years as incumbents look to fend off rising competition from fintech upstarts. 2019 was a year that saw several major deals, including Fiserv's takeover of First Data, FIS' acquisition of Worldpay and Global Payments' merger with Total System Services.
Not all deals have gone so smoothly, though. Visaterminated its acquisition of Plaid, a start-up that lets fintech apps connect to users' bank accounts, after the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the transaction on antitrust grounds.","Rapyd's software lets firms integrate a range of payment methods into their apps, including money collection and bank transfers."
2020-12-10,"Cleo, the AI-powered ‘financial assistant’, raises $44M Series B led by EQT Ventures","Cleo, the London founded “financial assistant” that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44 million in Series B funding.
Leading the round, which I understand actually closed earlier this year, is EQT Ventures. Also participating are existing investors Balderton Capital, LocalGlobe and SBI.
They join much earlier investors such as Entrepreneur First, Taavet Hinrikus, Matt Robinson, Errol Damelin, Niklas Zennstrom, Alex Chesterman, and Ian Hogarth — all well-known names in London’s tech investment community.
Targeting “Gen Z” and with a rather lofty sounding mission to “fight for the world’s financial health,” Cleo’s AI/machine learning-powered app connects to your bank accounts and gives you proactive advice and information on your finances, including timely nudges, to help you stay on top of your spending. Over time, the idea is that Cleo can help change your financial behaviour for the better.
The broader premise is that Cleo can replace your bank’s own app, and by speaking to you in a more human and user-friendly way, improve your financial health. In addition, and crucially — as Cleo founder Barney Hussey-Yeo is fond of arguing — the company can do all of this without having the same cost base or misaligned incentives of an actual bank.
The assumption made in 2017, when Cleo really got off the ground, was that through a combination of data science and machine learning, delivered in a fun and openly gamified way, the companys financial assistant chatbot could attract and retain gen z and millennial users. Then, after engaging with the app, users would have experienced enough value to upgrade to a paid subscription or various financial services offered through Cleo now or in the future. With 4 million registered users — 96 percent of whom are in the U.S. — the first part appears to be panning out.
Hussey-Yeo tells me the new funding round gives him a mandate to take some big product bets in order to move forward the financial health of Cleos users. [Those product bets] wont all work out, but if one or two of them connects, well fundamentally change the game in some of the most broken areas in financial services.
In addition, the company will expand its operations in the U.S., including building out executive and product teams in San Francisco.
When we launched in the U.S it became quickly apparent that it would be our dominant market, says the Cleo founder. We were signing up about 1,000 users per day in the U.K. at the time. After [just] a week, we were at 10,000 per day in the U.S. and kept growing.
Hussey-Yeo attributes a lot of the success state-side to better banking APIs in the U.S. with Plaid, which he says dramatically drove up conversion rates and lowered customer acquisition costs. This combined with a much larger market focused us 100% on winning in the U.S. first. This race is far from played out.
Hussey-Yeo says Cleo will always offer a free version “because everybody needs the ability to make smarter decisions about their financial lives”. In contrast, the premium product costs $5.99 per month and is intended for people who “need a little extra help,” providing features such as gamified savings, and “levelled up” credit scores with coaching. Premium users can also trigger a $100 salary advance designed to stop them dipping into a costly bank overdraft.
Meanwhile, Cleo says it has grown revenue by 400 percent in the last twelve months, and Hussey-Yeo tells me the company is now doing $10 million-plus AAR. In a further nod towards stronger unit economics, the cost to acquire a user is now less than $2 with the vast majority of users acquired organically.
“So were definitely not in growth at all costs mode,” he says. “Weve worked hard over the last 12 months to bring our payback period comfortably under 12 months which is an incredibly rare feat at scale for fintech.
One interesting aspect of Cleos mission and the strong personality its chatbot exhibits, is that the problem space the company is tackling is potentially based on behavioural science as much as it is data science. Hussey-Yeo doesnt disagree.
This is where the idea of a conversational interface came from, he says. I realised you could break the complexity down into a language anyone could engage with, and I mean actually look forward to engaging with it, to ultimately change their behaviour.
Today we have an outstanding machine learning department but just as importantly is the behavioural researchers and writers at Cleo. We know this is the combination that makes Cleo special and, I hope, will eventually lead to us being the financial advisor for a billion people.","Cleo, the London founded “financial assistant” that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44 million in Series B funding.

On the afternoon of Swift's 29th birthday, the model posted a photo of the pair at the 2015 AMAs. ""Proud of you always,"" Kloss wrote, adding, ""Happy Happy Birthday @taylorswift.""
March 14, 2019: Kloss said she 'loved' Swift's essay about turning 30
In anticipation of her 30th birthday, Swift penned an essay for Elle titled ""30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30.""
She cited the importance of acknowledging the difference between ""friendships"" and ""situationships"" in her 20s. 
""Something about 'we're in our young twenties!' hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you'll always keep the memories,"" the musician wrote. 
Swift also admitted that she began to feel like her ""squad"" had become the embodiment of her childhood insecurities - like sitting alone at school and lacking a solid friend group. 
When Kloss appeared on ""Watch What Happens Live"" several days after the essay was published, host Andy Cohen asked what she thought about the essay. 
""Taylor is incredible, and I feel really lucky to call her a friend, and she's one of the hardest working women, and I loved her essay,"" she said. 
June 20, 2019: Kloss and Kushner had another wedding, which Swift also didn't attend
Months after their first wedding, Kloss and Kushner had a larger celebration with friends at Brush Creek Ranch in Wyoming.
While Swift didn't appear in any of the photos from the event, Perry, who feuded with Swift in the past, and her beau Orlando Bloom did. 
Braun, who was at odds with Swift even before he famously purchased her former record company, Big Machine, in 2019, and his wife Yael Cohen were also at the getaway.
Braun has been Kloss' manager for years and often shares photos of the supermodel on his Instagram page.
A source close to both Kloss and Swift told Page Six that the ""Delicate"" singer was invited to both events.
A representative for Kloss told the publication that Swift couldn't attend due to prior commitments. 
August 10, 2019: Kloss vacationed with Braun in the midst of his feud with Swift
The music executive purchased Big Machine Label Group - and Swift's masters - for a reported $300 million in June 2019. After news of the acquisition broke, Swift aired her grievances in a Tumblr post. 
""I learned about Scooter Braun's purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world,"" Swift wrote. ""All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I've received at his hands for years.""
The singer explained that she ""pleaded for a chance to own my work"" for years before the sale but was instead offered to ""sign back up to Big Machine Records and 'earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in.""
Following Braun's purchase, celebrities and fans began to take sides, but Kloss stayed quiet.
And just months after the acquisition, Kloss took a week-long vacation with the music executive. 
Braun posted a photo of himself on a boat with Kloss and her husband Kushner. 
He captioned the post: ""Week of laughter.""
July 23, 2020: Kloss shared a photo with an eerie resemblance to Swift's 'Folklore' photo shoot on the same day as the album announcement
Karlie Kloss posted a similar photo to Taylor Swift. Karlie Kloss/Instagram; Taylor Swift/Instagram
Swift surprised fans by announcing the release of her eighth studio album, ""Folklore,"" on July 23. Along with a tweet about the album, Swift shared black-and-white images of herself in the woods on Instagram.
Shortly after the musician's announcement, Kloss posted two photos of herself in the forest that looked similar to Swift's pictures. 
She captioned the pictures: ""happy place.""
Given the women's history, fans wondered if the supermodel's photo was a nod to Swift's album, though she never directly mentioned ""Folklore"" or Swift in her post.
Later in the day, she also posted a video about her coding camp's partnership with Estée Lauder Companies. The opening segment shows lines of code, two of which have the words ""Easter Egg"" in them. 
Because the video came on the same day as the announcement from Swift, who's known for layering hidden Easter eggs about her personal life in her music, fans theorized that Kloss was subtly referring to potential hints about her relationship with the songstress on ""Folklore."" 
January 7, 2021: Fans were convinced Swift took a dig at Kloss on her 'Evermore' song 'It's Time To Go' 
After two additional tracks on the deluxe version of ""Evermore"" were released on streaming platforms, fans wondered if one of the songs, ""It's Time To Go,"" was about Kloss. 
The lyrics read: ""When the words of a sister come back in whispers / That prove she was not in fact what she seemed / Not a twin from your dreams / She's a crook who was caught.""
Beth Garrabrant/Taylor Swift
The words ""sister"" and ""twin"" led fans to speculate that Swift was referring to Kloss.
They also postulated that ""whispers"" and ""crook"" hinted at a betrayal the ""Evermore"" artist felt when their friendship ended. The song as a whole was about knowing when to leave a situation that's no longer serving you, so an ended friendship fits into the overall narrative, too.
Neither Swift nor Kloss confirmed the theories, however.

In an announcement on Tuesday, the US Department of Justice said the two companies have agreed to call off their merger. The agency filed a lawsuit to block the deal last Novem..."
2020-12-03,Justice Department Sues to Block Visa's Proposed Acquisition of Plaid,"Today, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to stop Visa Inc.s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid Inc. Visa is a monopolist in online debit services, charging consumers and merchants billions of dollars in fees each year to process online payments.  Plaid, a successful fintech firm, is developing a payments platform that would challenge Visas monopoly. 
American consumers and business owners increasingly buy and sell goods and services online, and Visa a monopolist in online debit services has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions, said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division.  Now, Visa is attempting to acquire Plaid, a nascent competitor developing a disruptive, lower-cost option for online debit payments.  If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa and increase entry barriers for future innovators. 
According to the complaint, Plaid powers some of the most innovative fintech apps.  Plaids technology allows developers to plug into consumers various financial accounts, with consumer permission, to aggregate spending data, look up balances, and verify other personal financial data.  Plaid connects to 200 million consumer bank accounts and 11,000 U.S. banks.  Because it accesses data on behalf of so many fintech app customers, Plaid has become the leading financial data aggregation company in the United States.  Plaid is planning to leverage its connections to build a bank-linked payments network that would compete with Visa.  Plaids money movement platform would allow consumers to pay merchants directly from their bank accounts using bank credentials rather than a debit card.  Plaids established connections and technology uniquely positions it to enter the payments market and disrupt Visas monopoly. 
The complaint alleges that Visas CEO viewed the acquisition as an insurance policy to protect against a threat to our important US debit business.  This acquisition is the second-largest in Visas history, with an extraordinary price tag of $5.3 billion.  Visas CEO justified the deal to Visas Board of Directors as a strategic, not financial move, and noted that in part because our US debit business i[s] critical and we must always do what it takes to protect this business.  Unless acquired, Visa feared that Plaid on their own or owned by a competitor [was] going to create some threat with a potential downside risk of $300-500M in our US debit business by 2024.  If Plaid remained free to develop its competing payment platform, then Visa may be forced to accept lower margins or not have a competitive offering.
Millions of American consumers and merchants depend on debit services to transact business online.  The complaint alleges that Visa has dominated online debit for years and has protected its monopoly with exclusionary tactics that have prevented rivals, including Mastercard, from expanding or entering. The lawsuit alleges that Visas proposed acquisition of Plaid is a violation of both Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 7 of the Clayton Act.  The Department filed its lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Visa Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Foster City, California.  Visa is a global payments company that operates the largest debit network in the United States.  Visas 2019 revenues were approximately $23 billion. 
Plaid Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.  Plaid is a financial services company that operates the leading financial data aggregation platform in the United States.  In 2019, Plaid earned approximately $100 million in revenues.","Today, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to stop Visa Inc.’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid Inc.

2021-01-12,"Visa Opts Out Of Plaid Acquisition, Cites Complex Litigation - pymnts.com","Visa has opted out of its $5.3 billion planned acquisition of Plaid after objections stemming from a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.
The antitrust suit challenged the acquisition, saying it would put Visa in a position to maintain a monopoly in the online debit card market. Plaid had been a nascent but important competitive threat, WSJ reported, and if Visa had been able to buy Plaid, it could have resulted in higher prices, less innovation and more of an entry barrier for online debit services.
We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaids capabilities are complementary to Visas, not competitive, Visa CEO Al Kelly said in a statement Tuesday (Jan. 12). ... However, it has been a full year since we first announced our intent to acquire Plaid, and protracted and complex litigation will likely take substantial time to fully resolve.
The proposed deal originated in January 2020, PYMNTS reported. Plaids service allows users to share banking information with apps like Chime and Venmo. For example, a user could sign up for Venmo and use Plaid to link their bank account automatically. The service, according to PYMNTS, was one that could have eventually let users bypass credit cards and transfer money directly from bank accounts to other types of services. The company has already integrated with over 15,000 banks in Canada and the U.S.

2020-12-07,Visa: Very Expensive,"There are only a few sectors that seem unfazed by COVID-19 and the resultant economic slowdown, and understandably, their stocks have breached historical highs in 2020. Contrary to that tenet, Visa Inc.'s (V) business is bearing the impact of constrained travel globally, and changed consumer spending patterns, but its stock has raced up by 55% since the selloff in March 2020, reaching, and continuing to hover around, a new five-year high. The pressures of 2020 notwithstanding, V is an excellent stock to own for long, but the stock has rallied too far ahead for there to be great value for investors buying now.
V's results for its FY ending September 2020 have been less than glowing. The company's revenue declined by ~5% YOY, its EPS declined by ~8% YOY. The company attributed the decline mainly to the fall in revenues from international transactions (down over 19% YoY), resulting from the reduced global travel and consequent decline in cross-border transaction volumes (down 16% YoY). Even as some countries began to open in H2 2020, the period of stress for V is far from over, evidenced by decline of about 29% YOY in cross-border transaction volumes in its Q4 FY20. Revenue from international transactions accounted for 29% (see table below), and stress on the segment will continue to impact V's topline in the near future.

</table>It is a telling point that in H1 FY20 (October 2019-March 2020, before the impact of COVID was fully felt in financials), V's net revenues increased 10% YOY. The pressure on revenue that manifested from H2 onwards is certainly a short-term phenomenon, an outcome of the global pandemic; and the company's fundamentals are robust enough to absorb the decline without impacting long-term business prospects. Even after the decline in FY20, V's profitability is exceptional with 65% operating and 50% net margins, and its balance sheet is robust, with an annual free cash flow of $9.7 billion in FY20 and a low debt/equity of ~0.7.
The other aspects of its business, like its strong volume growth in debit card volumes, its expanding access points globally (16% growth in FY20, taking V to ~70 million merchant locations), increasing contactless penetration and virtual cards, expanded partnerships globally and healthy renewals of existing clients, and robust growth in its value-added services (VAS, 18% growth in FY20), all are favorable aspects for the long-term business outlook of the company. There is also the potential for raising its swipe fees in the US, which should also provide an upward fillip to revenue. V's acquisitions, most recently of Latin America focused software platform YellowPepper, also seem focused on diversifying its revenue mix, by becoming a 'network of networks', allowing V to better market its VAS and traditional services in different markets.
While there is expected to be some margin pressure in FY21, the company has achieved cost savings even in FY20, and expects the capex in FY21 will remain around $700 million (FY19: $736 million), which should ensure that the robustness of V's financial health will remain unchallenged.
Then there is also the company's history of dividend payouts and stock buybacks, which makes it a tremendous stock to own. The company has indicated plans to continue using its free cash flow for the purpose in FY21; it bought back shares worth ~$8 billion in FY20, and the guidance that the practice will continue even in a difficult year, reflects well on the company's earnings quality.
The stock was an obvious buy when it slid sharply in the early days of COVID, when it fell by ~28% in the period Jan-March 2020. But the stock rebounded since then, barely 3% away from the five-year high of ~$216 it touched in September. Even the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filing to block V's $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, citing monopolistic practice, has not affected the momentum, with the price only increasing 7% since the DOJ filing on 5 November. With a TTM P/E of 43 times, V seems too expensive to buy now.
Some of the exuberance surrounding the stock seems to be centered around the availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, and the subsequent increase in consumer sentiment and spending. However, unlike UPS, where there is an expected long-term shift in consumer behavior and B2C distribution channels, optimism for V's stock seems heavily dependent on what must necessarily be seen as a non-recurring phenomenon: consumer spending went down because of the pandemic and it is now beginning to recover. There is nothing to say that the spending levels will reach newer heights on the other side of the vaccine, and that must be considered when looking at buying V.
It is likely that the stock will see a correction when the enthusiasm over increased consumer spending will normalize, and the market factors in that the strong growth expectation is buoyed in part by the low base of 2020. The company's own expectation, shared in October, for GDP recovery in the US is about 4.4% in 2021, which will moderate to ~2.9% in the following year. While the actual recovery rate will be subject to many variables, including the successful adoption of the COVID vaccine, recovery from the economic slump, both in US and globally, is unlikely to be the unwavering upward trajectory that the stock market seems to expect, as evidenced in V's price rally.
Apart from the timing, it is absolutely incorrect to suggest that V is not a stock to be bought or held. It is a great stock to keep if one already holds it. It is just not the best time to buy now, given how expensive it is, and there should be better points of entry when the stock market catches up with the realities of recovery.

Okay. Welcome to the morning session here. This is one of our keynotes here as part of Day 3 of our 24th Annual Credit Suisse Technology Conference, again, a four-day event running Monday through Thursday. On behalf of my colleague Moshe Orenbuch, together were happy to be hosting this session with Vasant Prabhu, whos the CFO of Visa.
With that, wed very much like to welcome Vasant to the conference. Thank you so much for being with us today.
Vasant Prabhu
Thank you, Tim. Good to see you. Good to be here.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, great. Well, weve got a good list of topics here. I want to start out with one that comes up often in investor discussions around acceptance points within the global network. So here we are in 2020 heading into 2021. And you mentioned recently that acceptance points within your global network were up about 16% year-over-year, and now at about 70 million merchants. And that number mightve surprised some folks in terms of it sort of suggests that there was a lot of runway coming into this year. Maybe in a post-COVID world, you could talk a little bit about the cash to card penetration or sort of the algorithm for overall payments volumes growth when we think about PCE penetration, new flows, et cetera.
Vasant Prabhu
Sure. Well, as you know, through the COVID period weve seen a significant acceleration of the shift away from cash to digital forms of payment, whether its in face-to-face transactions and shift to e-commerce, and that is an acceleration in the trend that was already on the way. But despite that its still an extremely long runway as you saw as you pointed out theres been a significant increase in seconds. If you look at the so-called developed markets, the U.S., Europe, where weve been at it for a very long time, theres still a ton of cash to digital. Our payment volume across the network is about $8 trillion today. Theres $18 trillion in cash still left that hasnt even grown up in the last four years, even though weve digitized a lot of cash. So that gives you a sense of how much more is left then.
And out of that $18 trillion, $8 trillion or almost as much as the volume we have today globally is in the developed markets. And there are three vectors of growth thats still left in our traditional consumer payments business. Youve got going into by near term smaller and smaller merchants thats facilitated by substantial improvements in acceptance technology, all the efforts that people like Square and others are doing, whereas the opportunity go deeper and deeper into smaller and smaller transactions, and thats facilitated by things like contactless, which is so easy to use and so frictionless that people use it all the time. And the vast majority of transactions even in developed markets are smaller transactions as people used to use cash flow.
And then of course the third vector of growth is the shift to e-commerce, which even though theres been an acceleration of the shift theres a long way to go. I mean, e-commerce penetration was still quite low coming into this and theres a significant amount of runway there. So were by no means anywhere near a point where there isnt a significant opportunity, even in the developed markets, and weve seen penetration levels for cash for visual forms of payment and consumer payments grow as high as the 90s in some countries like the Nordics and so on. And then you move to the emerging markets and the opportunity is even larger, right? Youve got a significant amount of opportunity to build acceptance. Technologies have come in now, that are drastically reducing the cost of adding acceptance points. You dont you no longer need an expensive point-of-sale device, you can use a smartphone. You dont need landlines, you can use mobile lines.
So youve got people like the wallet people, who are rapidly expanding acceptance. We are working with most of them to embed our credentials in them. We think that theres about $2 billion in additional credentials that could go into wallets. So wallets are substantially enhancing the penetration into the unbanked, into people who are not in the financial mainstream. So theres a huge opportunity to add the number of users, a massive opportunity in the wallets to add acceptance locations and bring them into our network. And of course, all the new technologies are making it much easier for people even in emerging markets to use digital forms of payments.
So, and thats just talking about our consumer payments business before we even get to what weve talked about for the last five years, which has even moved well past consumer payments into the moving money business. And thats $185 trillion opportunity in cash and checks. Massive opportunity is to digitize person to person payments, you know that. Theyre doing that to Visa Direct that is still growing over 70% even at a time like this.
Massive opportunity is in B2B, while tapping it in multiple ways. And weve got our traditional approach that go after e-cards and DMV cards and corporate cards. Weve got B2B connect that is going after the cross border opportunity in B2B. And then of course theres a large enterprise B2B, ARAP, which is a future opportunity. Theres $185 billion in cash and check in that area, which is 10x what we have in consumer payments. And we no longer think of ourselves as strictly digitizing consumer payments.
As you know, we think of ourselves as moving money and theres a loss expansion in use cases that come with that. And so, our view is the 10x opportunity we talked about is still available. Things like what we saw in the last few months have accelerated some of the trends that were already underway. But the opportunity is so big that if anything many new opportunities are moving along faster in the money movement space than they were a year ago. So theres no end in sight in terms of that need for growth.

Thanks, Vasant, and Id add my welcome also. You alluded to the contactless phenomenon in your prior answer. I wanted to drill down on that a little bit. Thats obviously that rollout is still underway or well underway in the U.S. Thats something thats helped help drive smaller dollar transactions, although, admittedly its more of a card present or in-person phenomenon for the most part. But could you talk a little bit about; number one, the idea that this that those transactions have their own incremental data processing fee, and I think would therefore have somewhat higher yields. But also the fact that that theres been I think the studies that weve seen have suggested incremental 20% incremental more transactions per cardholder when a customer is used to doing gets used to using the contactless card.
Vasant Prabhu
Yes. As you said, contactless, something weve been talking about for a few years, and then we started talking about it, Im sure some people were scratching their heads as to why is Visa so excited about this. Look, our business is to make payments as easy and frictionless as we can make them. And the more easy and more frictionless we make them, the more, lets say, pleasurable the experiences, if you can payment, the more people are going to use digital forms of payment. And as we saw contactless evolve outside the U.S., it became obvious to us that this was something that consumers loved. What we typically saw in most markets is that the adoption rates are extraordinary, and theres sort of an adoption curve here.
The first couple of years, theres a chicken and an egg thing. We want people to have cards that are contactless enabled. If they dont, they cant use it. We want merchants to enable contactless and then consumers have to feel confident that they can use contactless at almost very merchant. And then they start using it and then theyre hooked. And then what happens is that they abandoned cash payments almost entirely because tapping of card is so easy than fumbling in your wallet for cash, and the change and all that. And in addition, it speeds up lines. So merchants love it.
And so it takes a couple of years to get to critical mass and by year three it starts to take off. And when its in take off mode, you can see penetration jump from, lets say, it went from 0% to 7% penetration of all transactions into the 90s within two or three years. Weve seen that in Australia, were seeing it happen now in Europe.
And what it does is a few things for us. Number one, just the fact that weve created a much more frictionless form of payment is an advantage for us over other forms of payment. So it increases the propensity for people to use our cards or our forms of payment. Number two, because its so easy, you can start using it for smaller and smaller transactions and thats exactly what we want to develop, which is that we see an increase in the number of transactions because now people are using it for smaller and smaller transactions which in the past they might have used cash flow. And then the third of course, is that they displaced even tapping their phone. So we see very often that people may have been using other forms of payment, that they were tapping phones. And now they realize that tapping of card is so much easier than fumbling with your phones than needing to tap into that and people start abandoning those forms of payment.
And theyre making progress everywhere in the world. Weve seen truly in COVID months, a substantial increase because cash is dirty. People dont want to handle cash. And even in markets where it doesnt take off more, its even accelerating. Youve seen some substantial increases in penetration that weve talked about on our calls. And as it relates to the U.S., were making good progress. U.S. is the laggard because I hope wed get everybody in the U.S. the banks, the merchants to move into the direction, but now weve got any one of our top 25 issuers out in the process of issuing contactless cards. Well probably get to 300 million cards live in the U.S. with contactless by the end of 2020. Thats about a third of the cards we have outstanding. So we still have our ways to go.
We have a boss majority of merchants now about 260 of the 300 top U.S. merchants are contactless enabled. So now were getting to the point where in the U.S. may be close to critical mass in another year or two as consumers start to adopt using contactless, we should start to see that big increase that we saw in other markets. And what that means is that theres about 55% of all U.S. transactions that are less than $10 and they are in cash. And so theres a big opportunity here to digitize these smaller ticket transactions as contactless really begins to take off in the U.S. So we are very excited about it. Its just one vector of growth that is going to help us in the next few years. Its certainly helped us already outside the U.S. and the fact that cash has become so unattractive to use is only adding some momentum to it.

Excellent, Vasant. Thank you so much. I want to shift the conversation just briefly, and then well have back to some of the more longer term topics, but lets shift it over to the recent update that Visa put out, the 8-K. Just touching on some of the trends youve observed in November.
Vasant Prabhu
Sure. So we put out an 8-K yesterday, just to give you a sense of how the business was doing. I wont go through the numbers specifically because Im sure youve all seen the numbers, but Ill give you some sense of sort of what were seeing. You mightve seen as you went through the 8-K that trends were pretty good through most of November. One important thing I want to point out is the last paragraph we had in the 8-K. Its important I think for us to sort of highlight a few things.
Were in an unusual time with COVID going on. And the result of that what were seeing, and as youve seen where people shop, when people shop and on what they spend is changing. And so you sort of have to as we get into the holiday season, I think you have to be careful not to draw too many conclusions from one day or one week because of these changes going on. So just to give you an example on the issue of where people shop, youve seen a substantial increase in farmer shopping, not surprisingly, fewer people are going in store to shop, although as you know our economies have opened up, that have steadily picked up.
As you get into last week of November, and you can see it in the numbers, card present shows the debt. And thats because youre now lapping Thanksgiving week from last year when there was a lot of in-store shopping. And of course there isnt as much in-store shopping this Thanksgiving week. So that doesnt necessarily tell you how the holiday season is going to play out, because we saw an uptake in e-commerce that week, but that could very well spread out over the next few days or weeks, because people didnt go into the store, but that doesnt mean that shopping wont happen online. It doesnt mean it has to happen on the same day or the same week. So theres going to be these kinds of changes from year-to-year. So you have to interpret the numbers with some caution.
The other thing we saw last week, for example, that relates to COVID is that we did see an uptick in e-commerce, and we saw people spending more on retail goods. But one of the reasons the last three quarters have dipped down was at certain categories like food spending, certain other categories like restaurant spending were lower than they were last year because people didnt have big Thanksgiving dinners at their homes or family didnt come over like they used to, or they didnt feel comfortable going out to restaurants. So there are holiday-related changes on year-to-year that you have to keep in mind. So thats the whole question of sort of where people shop.
And then theres the issue of when people shop. So its very likely that people will spread out their shopping, now that theyre doing more of it online. Secondly, they go out and shop, they may not go out and shop, but that shopping mixture of online on a different day are over a period of time. For example, as you get towards the end of the holiday season, people often went in-store to shop because they didnt have enough time to get the goods shipped online or they forgot something. Wed have to wait and see what happens this year. What do people do for last minute shopping? Theres the online shopping trend that go deeper into the holiday weeks. Theres in-store part of it that happened in the last two weeks, bulked off.
So there are still question marks about when we will see the spending come in and then theres of course were on war. And the question is how much of the spending that is going into areas that are benefiting. So for example, retail goods is very strong. Home improvement is very strong. On the other hand, people are not traveling as much. People are not going to restaurants as much, not as much entertainment. So the question is how much of the spending that is not happening in these areas is going to go into good shopping and in total, where will we end up? So I think our view is that we dont have a clear picture of this holiday season until we get later into it. The good news is October was looking October was strong, November was strong all the way through, then we hit the holiday week. We will have to watch and see what the trends are for the next few weeks before we get a clear picture of the holiday season.
As it relates to the rest of the world, its a country by country. It depends on various factors, various holidays, et cetera. Another point that I would make is that tracking infections to see if theres a correlation between infections and spending and Im sure you are too. What we are finding is that there isnt as much a correlation between infections and spending as there is between mobility and spending. So it appears to us that even as infections climb, if it doesnt affect mobility, either because people are still willing and comfortable moving around, or governments are making imposing restrictions, it tends not to impact spending as much. So the index that we find thats more predicting predictive of what is going to happen with spending is mobility more than infections itself.
Now, suddenly these are early indications when we can monitor it as we go through. But all in all, the general take away from the trend is that the recovery trend we saw through the last quarter and into October is largely intact. Well have to watch the next few weeks to see how the holiday season pans out. And on the internet on the cross-border front, e-commerce remains very strong, cross-border travel, we told you it depends on opening borders. A few borders are opened. We see some traffic there. But otherwise, its all about the e-commerce growth in cross border that is holding it up and we did see some improvement there from month to month. So as a general sense of some of the trends were seeing and well tell you more when we talk to you in Danbury.

Great. Could we maybe move to one of the other topics that wed really like to discuss, and that Visa has made some great progress, building relationships with some of the leading FinTechs. Sometimes Visas taken an investment in some of them. And theres certainly been a number recently Revolut, which I think has got 7 million Visa cards, bet youve also had success with Chime, Squares cash card and many others. Could you talk a little bit about how what the steps that youve needed to take to be successful with this group of companies? And how big do you think that this bucket of card issuers could be over time?
Vasant Prabhu
Well, I mean, clearly this is an important new record of growth for us. Theres a lot of innovative business models being created, you mentioned a few. We certainly are partners with the most of them. They are becoming very important partners of ours for a variety of reasons. For example, in the Visa Direct business, we have the ability to enable a lot of new use cases. In every case, the way to scale these use cases is through partners and these partners are typically what we might call FinTechs.
So for example B2B, we are its a major opportunity, weve been at it for a while. We have a variety of partners there; on demand payroll, big opportunity, variety of partners there and a lot are helping us to scale the business. Moving to disbursements; so there is varieties again scaling those use cases, a bunch of FinTechs are doing that installments.
So one critical area that FinTechs can help us on and that we work with and we can help them scale, its a mutually beneficial relationship as we can help FinTech scale very fast, is enabling new use cases. Another great opportunity for us is in emerging markets, the partnerships with wallets, as wallets have dropped more financial inclusion as theyve increased the amount of acceptance of digital forms of payment and as they realize theyre working with us and help them create revenue streams, whether its issuance revenue streams or acceptance revenue streams. We are bedding up credentials in wallets, allowing our credentials to be used at the points of acceptance for wallets has been another important avenue for growth at a critical partnership.
In addition that our FinTechs are doing cross-border like Revolut and all the partnerships we have in Remitly and other remittance providers. So clearly when it comes to all the vectors for growth in our business, billing acceptance, adding more people with the ability to use digital forms of payment, i.e., bringing more people into the world of digital payments, scaling new and innovative use cases, this is where these FinTechs have a very large role to play. Theyre here to stay, theyre a critical part of the future growth of the industry. As far as looking with them I think what weve done and we made a lot of progress on this in the last few years is how do we make it easy for them to use our network, right.
Its very important to be make the on-ramp so to speak easy. So we have a fast track program, can bring them on board, do it in a way that is least disruptive from their standpoint. Do it in a way that allows them to use all our capabilities, very fast. Certainly the Plaid acquisition is aimed at having a company within the Visa system that truly understands FinTechs. Its been built by developers for developers, et cetera that allows us to offer more services to FinTechs. So theyre very focused on both how we can help them scale and how we can make them easy, make it easy for them to do business with us and so far so good. Were making great progress all over the world.

Excellent. Thank you, Vasant. I want to shift gears to the potential for European shared gains ahead. So Visa completed the global platform migration over to VisaNet in Europe in late 2018. And we gathered that prior to this, Visa wasnt going to market with maybe its full set of global capabilities and might not have had the same level of success thats either occurring now or could be ahead. And we fully realize that some of the contracts are longer-term in nature, but maybe you could talk us through the European business previous a year of acquisition, shortly after and then how things are evolving now that were a few years post.
Vasant Prabhu
Sure. Yes, I think you can sort of look at it in terms of a couple of phases. So clearly when we are quite busy or up, theres membership association and by definition, given more to serving the members and the membership was concentrated more than the UK and France and not as strong in certain parts of Europe, Central Europe in particular and parts of the Benelux. So Visa Europe was over developed in many ways you can say or have deeper penetration in share in the UK, France and to some extent countries like Spain. So the first order of business was to stabilize and maintain the clients that end with the acquisition and we did that very successfully.
The second part of business was then to transition them to the VisaNet platform so that all the capabilities of visa were available to all our clients in Europe and thats been done. So in the past two years, weve been very focused on them taking advantage of everything we now have available to enhance our business in Europe and the returns on that are now becoming more evident in our numbers. Clearly the opportunities were on multiple fronts. One, weve substantially updated the quality of our team there. We have substantially increased the resources dedicated to those parts of Europe that were underserved. Theyre calling on clients that Visa Europe did not call on the past and theyre delighted to hear from us and eager to do business with us. So theres clearly been great progress on the continent of Europe in building our business and switching business from competitors and making headway into business that may have been the local schemes and so on. And some of these things take time to show up in your numbers because conversions have to be done, transitions take time and so on.
We also had significant success with adding our value-added service and growing them. Weve enhanced the penetration of many of our value-added services in Europe, whether its CyberSource or CardinalCommerce that does authentication. Our traditional value-added service like fraud and so on. So clearly adding services and building the value added services business has been another avenue for growth. Beyond that, there was a lot of pent-up activity in Europe, when Visa Europe was independent, it was not something, unfortunately that they are focused on much. We made enormous headway in the last couple of years and more in really focusing on FinTechs in Europe, its night and day you saw the progress, we made the revenue and thats happened to the whole range of other FinTechs.
Moving past that, Europe is moving along on open banking and we see a ton of opportunity in new payment flows, Earthport is as you know based in the UK, Earthport gives us extraordinary access to bank accounts. Were making significant progress in Europe on the growth front too. So theres many avenues for growth in Europe. And we some of that in our numbers last quarter, where we saw a nice increase in the growth rate. Now some of this was helped by some things going on in the UK, but you need to take that out. You can see the impact of the wins coming in, you can see the impact of just greater penetration of acceptance.
Dont forget in Europe, in certain parts of Europe, theres still tremendous opportunity to digitize payments, whether its Southern Europe like Italy or Greece or elsewhere or Eastern Europe, theres still plenty of acceptance to grow they have opportunity to digitize cash and youre seeing all that go through. So we feel really good about it. Clearly its a multi-effort but I think from our standpoint and momentum right now, its very good.

Vasant, you alluded to kind of the services revenue and I think that was originally expected to be a mid-teens percentage of revenue. Could you talk a little bit, maybe just expand a little bit about the success of that, obviously that revenue stream probably has had better growth characteristics than the business overall.
Vasant Prabhu
Yes. So we did talk about this at our Investor Day to give you a much better day look for all our services and we gave you some sense of the size, because we dont break it all out in once in the line. The good news is that our services revenue grew 18% in fiscal year 2020, despite COVID. I think the fourth quarter growth is about 15%, but for the full year growth was in the 18% range, and it tells you that its quite resilient even in these times. And we also said that we expect mid-teens growth to continue in 2021. Just to give you more of a flavor for sort of where the services revenue is in our revenue lines, I think weve told you that about two-thirds of it is in our data processing line.
And the reason for that is, many of these are transactions driven businesses and the pricing is on a per transaction basis. And so going back to the IPO, a lot of these revenues were in that line. And most of the businesses that show up in the DP line and one of the reasons why the DP line group by-passed in the last quarter and through COVID despite the decline in transactions was because we had some of the services revenue there. Cybersource is in there, CyberSource is doing extremely well. CyberSource is benefiting from the shift to e-commerce from the shift to omni-commerce with the acquisition of Payworks and other things theyve done. They are very capable of providing omni-commerce solutions, which are very much in demand. Weve become a big enabler for acquirers, who offer omni-commerce capabilities to their merchant clients. So we looked through our acquirers, we enabled them to do omni-commerce and other services for their clients.
We just signed with Barclaycard, one of the largest acquirers in Europe, which is utilizing CyberSource to support their merchants digital payment journeys in e-commerce and omnichannel requirements. CyberSource also has a risk product, so we are seeing some nice growth there globally. So CyberSource is a source of growth. CardinalCommerce, our acquisition three years ago, doing extremely well. CardinalCommerce provides authentication services, its network of agnostic, some great global opportunity explained very fast in Europe. And then we also have our core fraud services and risk management services. And those also have some nice growth. Especially as transactions move to e-commerce, theres a greater interest in these fraud services.
And then one-third of the remaining revenue is bit between our service revenue line and the other revenue line. The service revenues have some of the top benefits that we offer as part of the package of our fraud services. And then the other revenue line has our consulting services and our data services. And theyre seeing some very nice growth there in consulting services, Visa Analytics platform, which is our beta product has grown significantly last year. One reason the other revenue line is impacted, it also has some of the marketing and travel related comp benefits. So when we offer marketing services to clients, our lounge and concierge services to consumers of our clients, card holder those theres not as much checkup for that all the time.
So even as our consulting and data businesses are growing the other revenue line includes things like these marketing and fable related services that are non-growing and they will recover and that line will start to show that. So well continue to build our value added services portfolio, youve seen us do acquisitions in this area. In many cases, we are willing to provide these services in a network agnostic way, our Bell ID, tokenization capabilities allow us to tokenize any transaction, not just those on our rails.
Verifi, our acquisition from about a year ago provides dispute resolution capabilities. So theres and now we just acquired YellowPepper, which is going to be a very easy way for many of our issuing clients who offer network-of-networks like capabilities, which is very easily connect to multiple networks as part of our overall strategy of being a network-of-networks. So clearly an area of growth, clearly good progress, clearly growing through the pandemic and more growth expected as we head into 2021.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, Vasant. I think you sort of alluded to a lot of the topics on the next question, but if theres anything to add, wed love to hear your thoughts around the capability additions. Many of them have been youve gone different routes, partnering, building, buying, and if you could just think, talk about some of those capabilities youre looking at and how you think about that decision.
Vasant Prabhu
Yes. Look, our approach to capabilities is, this is a business of partnerships and there are certain things theyre very good at, there are certain things that partners are good at. And its a win-win when you can partner, we can help them scale fast. They can help us, build use cases in markets fast. So partnership is the primary mode of growth in our business, but then there are certain set of what we call, what we would consider core capabilities, where we say owning the capability is important rather than partnering for that. And then we can build it or buy it. And weve done both. And typically our preference is to build, but where it is faster or cheaper to buy the capability, then theyre willing to do that too, that what was a case in point where it gave us very fast access to all the 99% of bank accounts in close to 80 of the largest countries, we could have built it. But it wouldve taken time.
We think weve got a great value and its going to create extraordinary value for us. Similarly in the case of Verifi, that really was only built a network, we could build it. We were already doing something along those lines, but it was just faster and more effective for us to buy it. So acquisitions will be in situations where the capability is something that we feel can be done better and faster if we go out and buy it.
We also do things like investing in companies. We invested in a lot of companies that we partner with, occasionally we may invest in a company that we think could be bought, Payworks is an example of that, we made an investment a few years ago, we bought them a year ago. YellowPepper was another example. Typically that allows us to get to know the company. We get to know how well they can scale, we get to know whether we can effectively partner with them to build our business. And if thats true, then we might buy them. And thats been our approach, we dont have a budget for acquisitions, its really a function of what makes sense to do.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. One thing I did want to touch on is that, Buy Now, Pay Later has been a very rapidly growing area within e-commerce. Some of the players are doing this through with the existing rails and some are trying to connect to the merchants directly and avoid the card rails. Can you talk about Visas place in the Buy Now, Pay Later space and how you think how you serve your customers on both sides of that and how you think thats going to evolve?
Vasant Prabhu
Yes. I mean, look, I think Buy Now, Pay Later is a big new way of paying. I mean, its been around a long time, but the way its being done now by other players, I think is a big long-term growth opportunity for them and for us and for our issuers. We even had it for a long time. We started with our investment in CloudNow years ago. CloudNow was one of the pioneers in the business, we are delighted to partner with them to start working with them, we started working with how we can use our rails theyve done what theyre trying to get done. We also invested in
PAYD and then we partner with all the major players Afterpay, Affirm, Splitit, et cetera.
So weve been going at it in a partnership mode for a very long time. And then in most cases, our goal is to help these people get what they want done and use our rails where it makes sense to use our rails or the network-of-networks approach where its needed.
[Indiscernible] and what theyre doing there is, if our issuers want to offer this, we are making our rails available to offer an installment solution. So we are already able to go with partners like is TSYS, the first issuer technology partner to offer our interest-payment solution at point of sale in U.S. Commerce Bank is the first bank in the U.S. to begin installments pilot for the planned commercial loans and even through CyberSource, theyre working with acquirers and FinTech installment providers such as Sizzle, and ChargeAfter to enable this sort of new way to pay for CyberSources merchant customers.
So, yes, I think this is a, its a watch this space kind of thing. Theres a big opportunity here, and were going off track on multiple fronts because we dont quite know yet exactly how this all will play out in the long run.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you, Vasant. With the minute or two, we have left. The ones lets see, if we could briefly touch on, comment you made earlier, actually you referred to some of your partnerships with the large remittance providers. And I believe in the past, youve talked about relationships with many of them. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what this gives these remittance providers in terms of expanding the breadth that theyre allowed, theyre able to offer in terms of account-to-account payments, how many markets they can add, how quickly they can integrate with you and the progress youve made on many of these partnerships.
Vasant Prabhu
Sure. Yes, and Ill do it quickly because I know were running out of time. Look, I think this is a phenomenal opportunity for us in terms of rem. Remittances are almost bigger than foreign direct investment in terms of money flows that go globally. What we do is, we give them extraordinary flexibility and lower costs. So used to be, you have to go to an agent, give the agent cash, agent will send the cash to another agent and the other agent would disperse cash.
Very expensive, very inflexible. What we can do is, you can sit in your home. If youre sending cash, lets say, I want to send it to you and youre in Mexico. I can sit at home, I can use my card, my bank account. I can do any way I want to send the money. I can then get it to you, I can send you a prepaid card that is reloadable and you can just get it on your car, or you can I can give it to you in a bank account, or I can give it to you on your debit card so I can send money card-to-card, card-to-account, account-to-account any ways you want. As well as the extraordinary amount of access we provide in terms of the number of countries and with Earthport the number of accounts we can reach.
So its massive increase in flexibility in terms of what a remittance company can provide their customers than they could before. And we can do it on like a lower cost. So its flexibility in costs, and we think its only the beginning, but we are excited about this. This is a business we will never in, because we were never comfortable with the merchant approach and all the risks that came with it with KYC and AML and all that. We now have a solution and its early days and plenty of growth available in the long run.

2020-12-10,Tesla lease guide: Everything you need to know about leasing a Tesla,"So you’re thinking of getting a Tesla lease? Smart choice. Have you considered the more affordable Model 3? Or perhaps you have the money to splurge on the beyond ludicrous Model S “Plaid?” What color? What added features? Should you buy instead of lease? These are all questions you’ll have to deal with.
Fear not prospective leasee, below is a comprehensive guide outlining what a new Tesla lease entails and what options to consider before you put the pedal to the floor.
Pick The Tesla Model That’s Right For You
The first step in making a major purchase is always to browse the aisles, research your options, and decide what’s best for you. Picking a Tesla is no different. The automaker currently offers four solid options in its fleet two sedans and two SUVs.
Tesla’s Model 3 sedan has quickly become the world’s best-selling electric vehicle to date due to its affordability without sacrificing too much performance. The other sedan, the Model S, is Tesla’s longest produced EV and has a track record of style and top speed (currently fastest in the world for its “Plaid” version). With the sporty design and top shelf performance comes a much higher price tag, however.
Tesla’s Model X is the automaker’s second longest produced EV and is by far its largest. It offers high grades in cargo room, range, and performance with plenty of upgradable options like six or seven seats. That said, it comes with the highest bill of Tesla’s standard models. The Model Y SUV is Tesla’s newest EV to hit the road, delivering in March of this year. As more of a crossover version of the larger Model X, the Model Y offers size, range, and performance at a more affordable price than its larger, older brother. 
Tesla started rolling out leasing options shortly after the debut of its Model S sedan in 2012. Since then, the three additional models to roll off the assembly line have all become available with leasing options as well  the Model Y being the most recent to launch its leasing program in July of 2019. Whether you’re looking for a Long Range Plus Model X with a seven seat interior, or a Standard Range Plus Model 3 with zero upgrades, there are leasing options available. Here are some further thoughts to consider.
How Much Will It Cost?
Note that all prices listed are as of publish date. For the sake of comparison, each model’s pricing pertains to a 36 month lease at 10,000 miles a year.
Tesla Model 3 Lease
To begin, leasing prices for a 2020 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus are $371 monthly for 36 months, at 10,000 miles per year, with $5,566 down (including acquisition fee) offering a total cost of $18,551. That comes out to roughly $515/mo including the down payment and acquisition fee, and $0.62 per mile.
Tesla’s Model 3 sedan is by far its most affordable option in the fleet, so this would be the best place to begin to grasp the low end of the leasing spectrum.
Tesla Model 3
Tesla Model Y Lease
Aside from being Tesla’s newest EV, the Model Y is also the second most affordable option based on standard starting price. 
Leasing prices for a 2020 Tesla Model Y Long Range are as follows: $499 monthly for 36 months, at 10,000 miles per year, with $5,694 down (including acquisition fee) offering a total cost of $23,159. That comes out to $643/mo including the down payment and acquisition fee, or $0.77 per mile.
Tesla Model S Lease
Tesla’s Model S is not the most expensive model per starting price, but certainly has the potential to be given all of its upgrade options.
That being said, to drive off with a 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range Plus, it will cost you $899/month for 36 months at 10,000 miles per year, paying $9,094 down (including acquisition fee) totaling a cost of $40,559. That bill is about $1,127/mo including the down payment and acquisition fee, or $1.35 per mile.
Tesla Model X Lease
The Model X is Tesla’s largest and most expensive standard EV to date, but boasts a huge interior and plenty of useful upgrades… if you can afford them.
For example, in order to lease a 2020 Tesla Model X Long Range Plus, it will cost $1,019/ month for 36 months at 10,000 miles per year, with only $9,214 down (including acquisition fee). That leaves a total of $44,879 which breaks down to $1,247/month including down payment and acquisition fee, or $1.50 per mile.
Tesla Model X
Tesla Cybertruck Lease
Hopefully you didn’t get your hopes too terribly high after seeing the word Cybertruck, because unfortunately Tesla’s “Frankenstein’s Monster” of an EV truck is not available for lease yet. Cybertruck is not scheduled to begin delivering until late 2021 for the single-motor, rear wheel drive (RWD) version. Worse yet, customers will have to wait util 2022 for any dual-motor trucks. It might be worth pondering a Tesla lease to hold you over until then, or ride your bike to save up (and save the planet)!
Tesla Roadster Lease
The original Roadster model was the first to hit the pavement bearing the Tesla name. It was originally created to showcase the potential of the rookie automaker, and its sporty design was meant to convince investors that electric vehicles could also be cool. Unfortunately, the original Roadster is no longer in production and therefore not available for lease. 
However, in 2017 Tesla announced a second generation Roadster in the works, but exactly when it may debut remains unclear. It was originally teased to deliver this year, but that was pushed to 2022 so Tesla could focus on Cybertruck. This past summer, CEO Elon Musk hinted that production on the new Roadster could begin in twelve to eighteen months. Time will tell, but trust that Electrek will be there to keep you informed when the news does break. 
Should You Lease A Tesla Or Another EV?
Even if you’re dead set on a Tesla lease after reading this guide, it doesn’t hurt to shop around and compare prices with other EV leases. The more informed you are, the better idea you will have about what leasing options work best for you. As a result, the more equipped you’ll be to get the best deal. Electrek has already taken the time to put together a meticulous EV lease guide, so a lot of the financial research has already been compiled for you. 
To truly determine whether a Tesla is the right EV for you is not a simple yes or no question. You certainly want to find an EV that stands out to you, one you could see yourself cruising around in for three years. The exterior look matters of course, but it’s what’s inside  and whether it fits your situation  that should be the true deciding factor. 
Dare to ask questions. What mileage will the EV offer? Are there any discounts from the manufacturer or tax incentives from the government for going electric? How much room do you need inside the vehicle? How many seats and how much cargo space? What sort of features come standard and what options would you like that may cost an additional fee? A constructive approach would be to compile a list of wants, needs, and absolute dealbreakers, and then compare different EVs to see which one checks the most boxes for you.
For example, our Seth Weintraub took an extensive look at the Chevy Bolt over the last few years, and while he didn’t land on sticking with Chevy, he laid out a good example for weighing the options.
Tesla Lease vs. Buy: What’s The Better Deal For You?
The answer to this one is truthfully subjective for each prospective Tesla customer, but it’s a genuine question to consider when you begin shopping around Tesla’s website. While the down payments are pretty much the same for either option, the money down on a Tesla lease may be less expensive than other EV manufacturers. Additionally, after three years you can trade into that new Tesla you’ve been eyeing. On the flip side, you’re locked into that same model three years on a lease, so choose wisely. If you buy however, you can upgrade whenever you want! 
Consider mileage as well. If you drive more than 15,000 miles a year, it’s a safer bet to buy, but if you can stay within the limits of the Tesla lease, you’ll pay slightly less over three years by leasing. Another factor to consider is maintenance. Because Teslas don’t require gasoline or oil, their upkeep is relatively simple in comparison. Add the fact that each model is updated by over-the-air software, you should rarely have to bring your Tesla in for anything. As a result, these EVs do not break down as quickly as combustion engine vehicles and accordingly retain more value over time. 
Furthermore, Tesla (while growing tremendously) is still trying to keep up with customer demand, leaving less EVs available than the number of people looking to drive one. As a buyer, you could also sell your Tesla down the road for cash back in your pocket, thus lowering your total cost of ownership. In large part to these facts, buying a Tesla is currently a more sound investment compared to a traditional gas guzzler. Whether buying is a better option than a Tesla lease however, is still a question of money, daily usage, and model variety.
Still not sure? Tesla actually offers a financing calculator on its website to help guide you toward whether a Tesla lease or cash payments work best for you.
What Is Tesla’s New Leasing Experience?
Just recently, Tesla announced improvements toward a new leasing experience for customers in 2021. More details are sure to emerge, but soon Tesla leasees will be able to use their Tesla account to manage everything from payments, to early termination, and even purchasing their Tesla at the end of a lease. Previously, Tesla leasees used a direct leasing program, but it appears that all leasing actions will soon be consolidated into a larger and more advantageous one stop shop via an individual’s Tesla account.
What remains uncertain, and a bit of a head scratcher for the Tesla community, is the fact the announcement email was sent out to all Tesla leasees, including those making payments on a Model 3 or Model Y. This is confusing because when Tesla began leasing programs for these two newer EVs, it specifically said it would prohibit leasees from buying their EV when a given lease came to term. It’s still unclear whether this was a general email to all leasees, or if Tesla has had a change of heart about selling its newer models to current customers. 
Keep An Eye On Tesla 
As the most valuable automaker in the world by market share, Tesla has quickly become a household name. With its land-speed-record pace of exposure has come several overhauls to several of Tesla’s previous policies pertaining to warranties, recalls, and return policies. Prospective and current Tesla leasees should check Tesla’s support page regularly to stay in the know about the leasing experience in 2021 as well as any other policy changes.
There you have it; hopefully you’re more informed after reading this Tesla lease guide and better understand what deals may or not be at your disposal, and how you should go about leasing (or not) your new vehicle. Your next decision might be whether to pay extra for the full-self driving capabilities. Good luck!

2021-01-13,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Visa, Plaid call off $5.3 bln deal","By Reuters Staff
FILE PHOTO: A Visa credit card is seen on a computer keyboard in this picture illustration taken September 6, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Illustration
(Reuters) - Visa and financial technology company Plaid said on Tuesday that they would terminate their $5.3 billion merger agreement following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at stopping the proposed transaction on antitrust grounds.
The U.S. Justice Department had sued to stop the deal in November, saying that Visa was a a monopolist in online debit transactions and that the proposed acquisition would eliminate a nascent competitive threat to that monopoly.
The deal, which was proposed in January 2020, was scrapped to avoid protracted litigation, said Al Kelly, chairman and CEO of Visa Inc.
We are confident we would have prevailed in court as Plaids capabilities are complementary to Visas, not competitive, he added.
Visa said in January it had agreed to buy the privately held startup Plaid in a $5.3 billion deal aimed at boosting the payments giants access to the booming financial technology sector.

Rob Wallstrom
Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on todays call. John Enwright, our CFO, also joins me today. Our quarterly results once again significantly exceeded last years earnings performance, as well as our expectations.
We expanded our gross margin rate primarily through sales of cotton masks and controlled promotional activity and we diligently managed our expenses achieving meaningful expense leverage. Our multi-brand strategy is proving to be powerful.
Customers are changing the way they shop and we have responded. Our digital competencies are becoming increasingly important especially in this quickly evolving environment. Somewhat fortuitously last year we acquired digitally-native Pura Vida and began working on critical Vera Bradley technology infrastructure and e-commerce site improvements necessary to position the company for future success. Those are enhancements went lives several months ago.
Our consolidated e-commerce business was very strong in the third quarter, reflecting growth from both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida. Even as our stores were reopened during the third quarter, our Vera Bradley digital business grew nearly 50% year-over-year and Pura Vidas e-commerce sales grew over 17% for the quarter, despite disruptions in the supply chain. E-commerce sales comprised over a third of total sales for the quarter.
By staying laser focused on the customer and by controlling what we cant control we have proven we can drive strong results and position ourselves to emerge a stronger and more resilient company, despite facing ongoing headwinds.
Our results were achieved through the innovation teamwork and determination of our entire organization. Even while working remotely our teams have demonstrated flexibility in decision making created new products and marketing initiatives and added efficiency to the organization. And our focus on cash management has driven us to think of creative ways to drive sales, expand margins and reduce expenses.
Let me turn the call over to John to review the financial results. John?
John Enwright
Thanks Rob and good morning. Let me go over a few highlights for the third quarter. As a reminder, financial results have been consolidated to include the July 2019 Pura Vida acquisition. This is the first quarter since the acquisition of a year-over-year quarters are comparable.
The numbers I will discuss today are all non-GAAP. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please reference schedules attached to todays press release. The current year non-GAAP third quarter income statement numbers exclude intangible asset and amortization. The non-GAAP income statement numbers for the prior year third quarter exclude the Pura Vida acquisition related charges and technology replatforming expenses.
Consolidated net revenues totaled $124.8 million for the current year third quarter, compared to $127.5 million in the prior year third quarter. Excluding charges, Vera Bradley incorporated non-GAAP consolidated net income was $10.2 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the third quarter, compared to $6.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share last year.
Vera Bradley direct segment revenues totaled $78.2 million, compared to $78.4 million in the prior year of third quarter. E-commerce sales growth of 48.8%, offset the 19.1% decline in comparable store sales for the quarter. Store traffic continues to be negatively impacted by the pandemic. The company closed 10 full line stores and opened six factory outlet stores in the last 12 months.
Vera Bradley indirect segment revenues totaled $22.3 million, compared to $24.1 million in the prior year third quarter, reflecting a reduction in orders primarily related to the pandemic and in the number of specialty and department store accounts.
Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $24.3 million, compared to $25 million in the prior year third quarter, a 17.2% growth in e-commerce sales nearly offset the sales to wholesale accounts, which were negatively affected by the pandemic.
Third quarter consolidated gross profit totaled $73.8 million or 59.1% of net revenues, compared to $74.1 million or 58.1% of net revenues in the prior year on a non-GAAP basis. The company expanded its gross margin in the quarter primarily through sales of cotton masks and controlled promotional activity.
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated third quarter SG&amp;A expense totaled $59.4 million or 47.6% of net revenues, compared to $64 million or 50.2% of net revenues. Current year SG&amp;A expenses were lower than the prior year due to both temporary and permanent expense reductions related to the pandemic. On a non-GAAP basis, current year third quarter consolidated operating income totaled $14.4 million or 11.6%, compared to $10.1 million or 7.9% of net revenues last year.
The uncertainties continuing related to COVID-19 make fourth quarter financial performance extremely difficult to predict. As a result, we are not providing forward looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we believe our inventories are well-positioned and marketing initiatives will drive traffic and sales. However, third quarter performance should not be considered a predictor of future performance.
We are facing certain headwinds in the fourth quarter, including the continued impact of COVID-19 on store traffic and capacity limitations in stores. Net sales may not be as strong for the fourth quarter and freight is a fairly significant headwind for all retailers as a consumer over indexes to e-commerce. Shippers are applying surcharges to each package during peak season and we have elected to absorb that cost and not pass along to the consumer.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet. Net capital spending for the third quarter and nine months totaled $900,000 and $5.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to total between $6 million to $7 million for the year, primarily related to technology and logistic enhancements, as well as new factory stores.
Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of October 31, 2020, totaled $77.3 million, compared to $48.8 million at the end of last years third quarter. We have $30 million of borrowings outstanding on our $75 million credit facility at the end of the quarter.
Quarter end inventory is $141.6 million, compared to $134 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Current year inventory was higher than the prior year, primarily due to receipts accelerated into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. We expect year-over-year inventory to be relatively flat at fiscal year-end. Rob?
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks, John. Now lets shift to an update on our two brands. We believe the way that customers live and work has radically and permanently changed. Both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida are particularly well-suited with our purpose driven casual, comfortable and fun positioning that dovetails perfectly into this consumer shift.
We remain focused on propelling both brands forward through innovation and product and marketing supported by state of art technology. Our new cloud-based technology platform is allowing us to respond to the rapidly changing environment and to harness customer data and feedback earlier and more instantaneously to drive this innovation.
First, let me update you on Vera Bradley. Lets start with product. I am very proud of the fabric and product innovation being driven by our talented, design, creative and product development teams.
We have a robust fabric innovation pipeline in place to continually update our cotton collection to develop new fabric offerings and to build on our platform of sustainable fabrics. This pipeline is important to our existing customers and helps us attract new customers to the brand.
Our full line offerings have performed well and our recycled reactive collections continue to gain traction and are highly rated by our customers. In the recent introduction of our ultra-light fabrication has been a popular addition to our factory stores. Stay tuned for more fabric innovation over the next 12 months to 24 months.
We also continue to introduce differentiated styles and silhouettes providing our customers beautiful solutions in all facets of our life. One key focus is our hands free products like our sling backpacks and cross bodies as they have become increasingly important to our customers particularly during the pandemic.
Our long-term focus continues to be on building on our dominance in our three core franchise areas of youth campus, every day and travel. Our travel segment has held up relatively well during this period.
Our products focus on soft travel items like our duffel and weekend collection for car trips or weekend getaways its proving to be more resilient than the hard luggage market in general. We continue to innovate and travel. For example, we are launching our ReActive lay flat travel backpack which takes our award winning lay flat functionality into our core backpack category.
A great example of innovation has been our cotton masks, which once again drove meaningful revenue in gross margin dollars for us during the quarter. We have continued to improve our offerings with new features, style, sizes, patterns and solids, and we are happy to provide our customers and the communities we serve with much needed personal protective equipment and provide a bit of verbally signature color and fun in the process.
Masks sales offered as we progressed through the third quarter but still comprised approximately 10% of Vera Bradleys total sales. While we expect the sales of masks will continue to soften in the fourth quarter and beyond, we are beginning to experience recovery in the core business which is offset the masks volume decline in third quarter.
Our trend light colors and patterns continue to be important to our customers. Paisley remained our number one brand, but our customers are also drawn to our emotional novelty brands and smaller soon to sell out capsule collections. These always add excitement to our assortments and a sense of urgency for our customers to shop. Our Best in Show Dog Print launched in the third quarter and was a fan favorite and even top last years wildly popular Cats Meow pattern.
This holiday season comes with a focus on gifting and cozy and a combination of festive and whimsical patterns like Merry Mischief in coordinating classics and neutral textures like our teddy fleece and cozy plaid.
We are offering an expanded assortment with customer favorites like blankets, slippers and cold weather accessories, and we expanded cozy into more apparel like lounge wear robes, puffer jackets and fleece. These items have sold out quickly.
Our collaborations in strategic partnerships continue to engage existing and new customers expand our reach, increased brand awareness, generate media attention and provide opportunities for us to strategically test and ultimately enter new product categories. We are continually approached by well-known brands with collaboration and partnership opportunities, which speak to the strength and wide appeal of the Vera Bradley brand.
In August we launched our newest Disney collection on verabradley.com and our second annual collaboration with Clocks. In October, we introduced our signature masks and 1982 Backpacks in Target stores and on target.com. And earlier this month, we were able to replenish and add to our extraordinarily popular Vera Bradley plus Harry Potter collaboration that originally launched in July and sold out quickly, and look for more exciting collaborations in 2021.
Let me switch to marketing and customer engagement. Our talented digital and marketing teams have completely transformed the way we communicate and engage with our customers and touch the communities we serve.
As we focus on reinforcing our position as an ESG organization, we continue to strengthen our community support and charitable efforts under the umbrella of VB Cares, particularly through organizations that could both family improve the lives of women and children.
Even though we were unable to hold any large fundraising events this year through the generosity of our associates, customers and other supporters, we were able to raise $1.4 million to support lifesaving research at the Vera Bradley Foundation Center for Breast Cancer Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, bringing the total rate to-date in support of breast cancer research $36 million. Additionally, we are continuing our yearlong support of other impactful organizations like New Hope Girls and Blessings in a Backpack.
Another aspect of BSG and our VB Cares focus is caring for our associates. We are so thankful for all of our associates and are especially grateful to those that have served on the frontlines making sure our customers have safe and exceptional experiences day in and day out especially during the pandemic.
We were once again thrilled to award a quarterly bonus of up to $500 based on hours worked to each distribution center store and customer service associates for their continued contributions and devotion to Vera Bradley during this extraordinary time. Over the last two quarters we have paid over $800,000 and well-deserved bonuses to our frontline associates.
In the third quarter we successfully launched our new verabradley.com site, which allowed us to improve our customers online buying experience and offer enhanced content to guide purchasing. We added a number of key site capabilities and have experienced a triple-digit improvement in revenue attributed to our search engine optimization.
Our digital and marketing teams have been successful in accelerating digital and customer growth, our well-timed investments in customer data science business analytics and AI positioned us well as we have navigated through the pandemic allowing us to collect and analyze data in respond to customer changes and adjust marketing spend in an agile way.
Using our data centric program buying, we have significantly increased our paid media efficiency and revenue attributable to paid media during the quarter. We continue to see strong performance from our digital media optimization.
Our return on ad spend in the quarter improved double digits led by campaigns like washable handbags and toes, which have resonated with customers as they are managing through the pandemic.
Earned media remain strong during the third quarter with over 3.3 billion impressions. We had exceptional media coverage of our mass effort supporting communities and healthcare workers, Breast Cancer Awareness Month and our foundation efforts, and our brand collaborations and partnerships. We rolled out customer journey centered activations with high response rates, including a welcome journey for new Harry Potter customers and for masks purchasers new to our brand.
Vera Bradley has always been a brand about connecting with people and we continue to see best in the industry engagement rates on Facebook and Instagram. Our second launch with Prox continued partnership with Disney in collaboration with Warner Brothers for Harry Potter gave our customers plenty to talk about in the quarter.
This has helped our customers have a community to connect with in these difficult times and a way to find some fun and bright moments. This engagement has increased both followers and sales with third quarter revenue attributable to social media up triple digits year-over-year.
Our store and wholesale teams continue to drive results through innovation and creativity. Although, our digital business is becoming a larger portion of our revenues, both factory and full line stores continue to be an important part of our omnichannel strategy.
We continue to focus on enhancing and reinventing the customer experience in both our full line and factory stores. While the pandemic and mandated capacity limits have challenged store traffic we are using customer data to strengthen relationships by offering appointment shopping particularly for our top customers face time and social selling, buy online, pickup in store and curbside pickup or possible. Appointment selling was very successful generating nearly 10% of our full line revenues in the quarter.
Our loyal customer retention at the end of third quarter is actually better than it was at the same time last year. This is a testament to our new digital and data analytics programs. Our customers love for the brand and our associates devotion to our customers.
We have created more excitement in six Vera Bradley full line stores by adding pure data shop and shops after a successful test in Birmingham, Alabama. We will continue to leverage opportunities for both brands and we will be rolling out a Vera Bradley plus Pura Vida Charity Bracelet program at Vera Bradley next year.
In the factory stores we are testing line busting technology in several high traffic locations, offering customers the opportunity to scan the QR code and receive a text message, what is their time to return to the store. They may also scan a QR code to review our electronic lock book and decide what they would like to buy while waiting in line. In the aggregate, our factory stores continue to outperform our full line stores compared to last year as customers felt more comfortable shopping in outdoor centers than in closed malls.
Our customer satisfaction scores are consistently industry leading despite pandemic related disruptions. We are striving to create a seamless shopping experience no matter where she chooses to shop. Our omnichannel customers are our most valuable, on average spending three times more than the single channel shoppers.
We have opened six new factory stores and expanded and renovated one factory store this year. We continue to focus on improving the productivity of our full line stores. We have permanently closed seven full line stores so far this year and expect to close five more by year end. This will bring our total full line closings to 38 since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and we expect to close approximately 10 additional locations next year.
On the wholesale side of the business, Amazon is our highest volume and fastest growing account. As Amazon continues to grow, we have put resources against this business to optimize our inventory, assortments, assured pricing integrity and drive volume.
Now lets talk about Pura Vida. We remain excited about the potential of our Pura Vida brand. Pura Vidas year-over-year third quarter e-commerce revenues grew over 17% despite significant supply change -- supply chain disruptions that impacted sales early in the quarter.
As inventory normalized, e-commerce growth substantially accelerated in the back half of the quarter. Using Vera Bradleys global sourcing expertise we have quickly strengthened Pura Vidas supply chain, diversifying raw material sourcing and adding three additional production facilities in countries outside of El Salvador.
Of course, total revenues were also affected by sale to the wholesale channel, which are beginning to recover as specialty stores reopen and start to reorder. During the third quarter we were able to divert some wholesale inventory into our e-commerce channel.
At Pura Vida innovation in product is first and foremost. We continually introduce new styles of the Pura Vida signature core bracelets and style packs, and we have continue to add to our popular metal, mood and semiprecious collections which are at a higher price point than our traditional string bracelets.
This category expansion and product diversification is working. In fact nearly 50% of Pura Vidas e-commerce business in the third quarter was comprised of jewelry categories other than the traditional spring bracelets, underscoring the brands lifestyle appeal.
Pura Vidas fall launches were a success. Our celestial collection was a big winner once again proving that beyond the bead styles resonate with our customers. Earrings, the necklaces continued in popularity as we further expanded our above the keyboard offerings for those not only living but working from home. Personalization is a continuing popular trend. Customers can personalize their signature core bracelets by choosing the color combination or charm special to them.
Our engravable collection launched earlier this year has taken off with customers loving the customization of bar necklaces, rings or coin bracelets. We have expanded the styles of engravable planks, including those embellished with birth stones or with zodiac signs and we have added a thinner necklace where both sides can be customized with engraving.
Pura Vida signature charity bracelets will always be an integral part of the Pura Vida lifestyle and continue to be a growing category as they are so special to our loyal cost minded customers. We are continually adding to our popular charity charm bracelets that we introduced earlier this year and to our charity style packs that support many amazing causes that are cherished by our customers.
We developed two styles for Suicide Prevention Month in September and partnered with Bording [ph] for breast cancer, selling four styles of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October. The expansion of the charm and style packs to our charity assortment is not only enabling us to increase our price points but to increase total donations to these great causes. To-date, Pura Vida has donated over $2.8 million to more than 200 charities.
For holiday, we have an expanded offering of gift sets and fun advent calendars packed with 12 days of surprises. Its super sparkly style pack from one of our most well-known influencers, Aspen Haggard [ph], our bigger collection of engravable jewelry and even more charms including Zodiac and Wildlife Charity styles.
Pura Vida is continuing to expand on the distribution front. Earlier this year, we launched our Canada Shopify fulfillment capabilities and began wholesale distribution of our products in Europe to complement our existing e-commerce business and third-party fulfillment there.
We already have many Pura Vida fans around the world and this global expansion is not only allowing us to serve those customers but extend our reach to others. Although, we are early in our international expansion we believe there are more opportunities ahead. Our first Pura Vida retail store that was scheduled to open this year was delayed due to the pandemic. We expect to open this exciting retail concept in San Diego next year.
Pura Vida is truly expert in engaging customers, building loyalty and introducing new devotees into the Pura Vida lifestyle. Our monthly bracelet and jewelry clubs ensured club programs are all creative ways to connect our customers with our products and lifestyle and cultivate loyalty.
During the quarter earned media was strong with healthy returns and spend and Pura Vida doubled its estimates less from last year to $1.2 million active subscribers, which drove meaningful revenue.
On the marketing front, Pura Vidas social media engagement is strong. Pura Vida remains one of the most highly engaged brands in the accessory space on social media, with over 2 million Instagram followers. Pura Vida is consistently listed as one of the most, if not the most, engaged jewelry brands on Instagram.
A lot of Pura Vidas marketing strategy and overall success is driven by its devoted group of brand ambassadors and close to 150,000 active micro influencers. These passionate advocates help us spread the Pura Vida movement, showing their devotion to the brand, while scoring perks along the way.
These ambassadors and influencers create compelling and exciting content, create buzz about our product and share that excitement with their followers and fans. Like our holiday collaboration with Aspen Haggard, we have several more exciting influencer product launches lined up in the months ahead.
TikTok has taken off with 115,000 Pura Vida followers. TikTok puts feature influencers on bailing boxes showing sneak peaks of new items, promoting giveaways and giving tutorials. TikTok generates interest in followers with creative engaging content and drive sales by linking the Pura Vida online store and occasionally offering special promotional codes.
Speaking of TikTok, we have moved the much anticipated launch of the Pura Vida bracelet influencer style pack with the reigning queen of TikTok, Charli DAmelio, to spring 2021 due to production delays. We want to make sure we have enough product to execute and we are sure will be an incredibly successful launch. 
Charli TikTok followers had grown by 20 million fans in just over three months to an astounding $100 million and she has over 34 million Instagram followers. Her target demographic thats perfectly with the Pura Vida brand and we are thrilled with the upcoming partnership.
We believe the strength of the Pura Vida business underscores the opportunity for discovering other small high growth potential brands like Pura Vida with unique product to marketing position that could become part of the Vera Bradley family brand. 
Now more than ever, I am confident that we are in the right space with our purpose-driven casual, comfortable and fun lifestyle brands at both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida. Both brands have unique growth opportunities, particularly as our focus is on customers who live beyond the major city centers and its customer base is growing as they migrate from big cities to smaller communities. We are positioned well for the future. 
Operator, we will now open up the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will now take our first question. It comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Please go ahead, sir.
Oliver Chen
Thanks so much everybody. Appreciate it. So the margins are really strong, but the direct was a little lighter than what we had modeled. What are you seeing in terms of the comp store sales and traffic trends and/or I am sure theres a fair bit of volatility and how has inventory trended in that channel relative to your expectations?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. Thanks, Oliver. From a traffic perspective in the third quarter, we saw improvement obviously from the second quarter in both the factory and full line channels. Of course, factory was better than the full line channel. So we saw better traffic it getting to our stores as we opened up our stores right in earnest in the back half of third quarter.
But from inventory perspective, I think, we are well positioned from an inventory perspective for both brands. We have outside of the beginning of this third quarter, Pura Vida got back into inventory late in the quarter, and ultimately, I think, accelerated their sales into the first part of the quarter was a little bit challenging from an inventory position perspective. In regards to stores at the Vera Bradley brand, we were well positioned in inventory for the full quarter.
Oliver Chen
Okay. And as we think about the comp and model the comp, what are some dynamics that you saw on conversion versus check size in the quarter that we just had and any thoughts going forward, will traffic continue to get better? Hopefully theres added visibility on a reopening?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. So from a conversion perspective, conversion was definitely up in all channels, whether that is e-commerce, whether that is the fashion or the full line, because of individuals who came out -- came out to shopping, really came out to buy. So we saw conversion increase.
We also saw kind of ADS. We the actual check go up. People were buying a little bit more, but we actually also saw the AUR go down a little bit based on the fact that our masks square portion of the purchase in -- at a $8 price point thats going to bring AUR down.
As we look into the fourth quarter, I think, its really -- its going to be some challenges and the stores its going to be associated with capacity as all retailers kind of deal with the capacity constraints of certain states or certain cities in regards to what they are doing in regards to COVID-19.
But you know the hope as we move into next year would be that the vaccine rollout kind of stores, the malls open up to get traffic back to where we thought it would be as we entered into this year. But as you can imagine factory stores from a traffic it looks like the people still feeling a little bit more comfortable going to kind of outside malls or some inside malls.
Oliver Chen
And then Pura Vida all the details and strategy are helpful. I know you called out supply chain in the wholesale as being factors. Could you elaborate on when those might have better visibility in terms of timing and improvement on those features of Pura Vida?
John Enwright
Yeah. So from a supply chain perspective we have corrected some of the challenges that we had. And Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks that we are now working with additional vendors to help kind of on the supply chain that we are not only can fully reliant on the El Salvador plant. From a wholesale perspective, we has -- our stores opened up, as we look at this thing we think thats why we will see a correction from a wholesale perspective for Pura Vida.
Oliver Chen
Okay. And Rob on product for fourth quarter and then next year, which products would you prioritize as most impactful to an outlook in terms of 
Rob Wallstrom
In terms of, I guess, what is -- are you specifically regarding Pura Vida or Vera Bradley about?
Oliver Chen
Vera Bradley brand.
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. Yeah. I think with Vera Bradley, I think, theres a lot of innovation coming. So in fourth quarter I think what becomes really important is, everything that we do around fleeces and home and cozy. Obviously, its really important in this time and year kind of all of our holiday patterns.
But we are seeing now with hands free being really important as we moved through the fourth quarter, we think that will continue into next year. And then if we look at next year continuing with our collaboration and we now believe which is really important and then continuing with our fabric innovation and those are two things that become really important have across categories.
The thing thats been interesting is if we have watched our youth travel and everyday business, you know we were expecting to see a lot more suppression in the travel business and its basically trended more similar to the rest of our business. So thats been encouraging to see because we are more in that soft travel, car travel category, which is held up better than kind of that hard luggage air travel and so thats been encouraging to see.
Back-to-school was difficult back in August, but we saw some strength coming in September, and obviously, we are hopeful as we move through next year and get to back to school. But it will be in full return hopefully by the time we get to next fall.
Oliver Chen
Thank you very much. Best of luck. Happy holidays.
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks, Oliver.
John Enwright
Thanks, Oliver.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Please go ahead.
Mark Altschwager
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the fourth quarter for a moment and you mentioned that I think sales might not be as strong in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, understanding that the environment is tough to predict here. But something you could expand upon that a bit, is that primarily conservatism related to store capacity. I guess with consumers focus shifting to get being made less of a headwind related to back to school. I would think that continued sequential improvement might be possible. So maybe just talk a little bit more about the puts and takes there and how you are thinking about the holiday?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think that the holiday season, right? This holiday is definitely not like any other, right? I think what we have seen in retail in general and we have seen in our numbers is consumers move forward some of their spending. We had a very, very strong start to November. We were feeling very good. Obviously Black Friday, you can tell from all of the market reports, while there is suppression in store traffic as of Black Friday and so we will just watch and see how it plays out over December.
I think a couple of days in fourth quarter that are out there is that, as COVID started pulling back on capacity issues that caused a little bit of texture in some of our stores and in some of those capacity pullbacks had been pretty large and so that has been a pressure that we have seen in fourth quarter that we do not see as much in third quarter.
And then the second question just can become with the e-commerce as we move through the earlier shipping, right, and all of retail some of the businesses moved on e-comm and how that impacts that last week before Christmas will people get back out in the stores. Theres just still a little bit of uncertainty out there and so we will watch how that works through.
And then the other thing just from an earnings standpoint, right, there are shipping surcharges and additional pressure in fourth quarter that we havent had the rest of the year. So those are kind of the three key points, right?
The reduction in capacity in stores, once the e-commerce shipping, deadline ship off what happens with the customer and third the surcharges, and so those are the things we are watching in fourth quarter that are unique.
But its not that we think that there is an underlying weakness with the consumer or what we are seeing going on. We think the consumer is continuing to respond to novelty and innovation and so we see it just is kind of navigating through this COVID holiday and then moving into next year and hopefully next year momentum will continue to pick up.
Mark Altschwager
Okay. Thats really helpful. Thank you. And then, on the marketing front, can you talk about how you are engaging with some of the new customers you have acquired with the mask sales over the last couple of quarters. Are they coming back to purchase other categories? I guess what is that behavior looked like in terms of repeat business as the last couple of months have progressed?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. No. Its been very encouraging, both the new customers that we brought in through our mask business, as well as customers that we have brought into Harry Potter. We have very specific marketing journey to get to both of those customers to really engage them with the brand more deeply and widely. We have seen really good response from those customers in terms of coming back. So we are encouraged that we will be able to keep all those customers we have gained.
Mark Altschwager
Got it. Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess, last one for me just bigger picture, Rob, you discussed this permanent shift in consumer behavior in a multiyear journey in terms of evolving what the store base looks like. But any changes to how you are thinking about that in the medium-term just in terms of stores versus digital? And for the outlook business specifically, isnt your approach evolving for online outlet relative to store outlet business, any high level thoughts there would be great? Thanks.
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. In terms of overall, right, the journey we have kind of been on we have been -- we had talked about reducing hours full line store fleet, as you see we are projecting to continue to do that next year and we will watch in the mall development very closely to see what happens and in enclosed malls going forward.
On the outlet front store, we still feel that theres opportunity in the outlet channel. We have -- we are very happy with overall how the outlet channel has been performing, customers are coming back faster to the outlets and they are coming back to the enclosed malls. So we see that as an opportunity.
We still are very cautious about moving the online outlet onto a digital platform just because of making that off priced product more highly accessible and so we still primarily see our factored business as a brick-and-mortar strategy.
Mark Altschwager
Great. Thanks so much and best of luck.
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks, Mark.

Thanks, Mark.

Steve Marotta
Good morning, Rob and John. As far as the recent COVID hotspots and you mentioned, of course, its negatively affecting capacity in the stores. Is it having any effect on the e-commerce activity in those areas? In other words, you find that if people cant get in the stores e-commerce is going up or because of the restrictions and people not feeling very good about anything that sales are going down in those areas as well?
Rob Wallstrom
I think that, overall, its definitely not as quick as, you slow downed the stores and then all passed on the e-commerce as they got e-commerce helps offset some of that, which I think we have seen in the industry and we have seen in our channels over this year.
But as you -- as areas start to spike we do see just consumers starting to pull back particularly for the first few weeks the things change, right, everybody I think begins to rebalance their life and we see a short-term impact and then usually with time those things begin to medicate.
John Enwright
And the only thing I would add to that to Marks question a minute ago is, from the factory perspective when capacity goes down from a factory perspective we dont have an outlet for that -- from an e-commerce perspective
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah.
John Enwright
 for those customers to buy.
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah.
Steve Marotta
Okay. I understand. And Rob, maybe you can provide a little bit of your outlook for fiscal 21, not obviously from a guidance standpoint, but just from what you see as the trajectory of the consumer over the course of the year the vaccine opens the economy back up again as specific guidelines are reduced, obviously, its going to be good for your business in some respect. Do you think there will be different styles that will be utilized? How do you best prepare and capitalize on the reopening and the timing of the reopening?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think the first half of the year, right? Its definitely going to be continuing to navigate in a pretty dynamic environment. I think we are all hopeful that as we get summer, theres some normalcy starting to come back and I think both brands are well positioned.
If you think about what we expect to bounce back disproportionately would be things like summer travel. So that whole travel piece of business whether its in our travel categories or Pura Vida with all their beach lifestyle and people getting back to beaches and getting out and doing all that.
I think the second big one that we expect to really pop back strongly is back to school and I think theres a lot of impacts from that. Theres -- under the Vera Bradley business in terms of the back to school business obviously this year I think theres a lot of pent up demand. So we are hopeful there.
And secondly, Pura Vida, they do a lot of products around fundraisers and schools and teams and people come use their customizer pack to do fundraisers, and obviously, this year since a lot of that did not happen that business were softer. We think that thats a real opportunity to bounce back next year. So there could be a lot of positive momentum in the back half of next year as travel and school kind of pop back and return.
Steve Marotta
Thats very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question is a follow up question from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Oliver Chen
Hi. Thank you. A few more just on the shipping and what you are seeing with the shipping deadlines. Is that then limiter to some of the revenue growth and/or as you look at elasticity as issues although you are taking the surcharge? I mean has there been any consumer differences with cancellations and/or timing. And would also -- just this is very hard to forecast, but as you look forward with mask, how are you thinking about planning inventories in that situation and that being a big part of the business currently? Thank you.
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think it from the shipping deadlines. I think we have been managing through shipping deadlines capacity well. I am sure you have seen some of the headlines out there that we were able to secure our capacity needs with UPS and we are managing through that. So we dont have any disproportionate delays here.
We have actually been encouraged by how shipping and logistics piece has been working from just on time performance. Thats not really the issue. There is a surcharge issue, which there is expense associated with that.
I think the bigger question is when the shipping cut off happened and so much of the business has moved to e-commerce is what does the consumer do from that kind of shipping cut off of approximately you know 12/15 through 12/25, right, that 10-day window, as she go back out to store like she has traditionally or not. I think thats the big question mark as we move through the holiday.
John Enwright
And in regards to mask, right, I call the Aspen mask [ph]. We do think masks are going to continue to base price as a percentage of total sales. We do -- we think they are going to be important part of business for the fourth quarter and we think into the first quarter, but how it plays out after that we are unsure.
Oliver Chen
Yeah.
John Enwright
Yeah.
Oliver Chen
Okay. And Rob on Amazon, which you called out in the prepared remarks and pricing integrity, what are some of the key guardrails that you have there and what are the main benefits and opportunities that offset some of the risk factors of partnering and deepening the relationship with Amazon?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think, one, really building kind of a strategic partnership with Amazon was really important, with really dedicated resources people who really understood the channel. And we worked on making sure that we were pulling back on either counterfeit product that was available digitally out in the world and pulling that back to a lot of activities we have been doing there which helps with price stability, making sure that we are working with our other wholesale partners to make sure that they are maintaining price integrity.
And doing all of those things has really helped us manage the price integrity on Amazon. And I think its just in this new world really being on top of data and management making quick decisions day in and day out has made that partnership effective.
The other thing that we have really used Amazon for is, key category penetration, right, there is so many people shopping on Amazon when people are looking for things like backpacks or masks or kind of category type of conversations, we want to be part of that storage, part of the conversation and we can really pick-up new customers that way, which is the reason why we have really lean into it and we have been very happy with that partnership today.
Oliver Chen
Thank you. And finally on the promotional environment, as that you have been seeing it. How have you been seeing it and how has your merchandise margins been relative to your expectations and what you around seeing in terms of being competitive relative to competitors as well?
John Enwright
So, with regards to merchandise margins, they are meeting really kind of our expectations. We havent -- from a bureaucratic perspective we havent been significantly more promotional. In the third quarter, we are controlling the promotionality. As we look into the fourth quarter we are just being we are looking at kind of what others are doing and they are trying to ensure that we play in the appropriate space.
But as we have introduced in kind of Vision 2020, we want to continue to drive full price selling versus kind of just revert back to kind of our time. So we are being thoughtful in kind of how we are promotional throughout the season. But we want to make sure that we dont leave any opportunity uncovered.
Oliver Chen
And just finally, you have been a pioneer with using a lot of the data in AI for personalization and algorithms internally. Whats the latest there in terms of like results that you have seen from implementing that technology in the organization?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think that what we have seen, one, is as we have seen a real acceleration of our consumer growth and kind of that 25-year-old to 40-year-old category and a lot of that has been a very specific targeted marketing.
We also think as we moving forward as we are continuing to diversify our customer base. Really using a lot of very specific algorithms to really target consumers is really going to help us really talk to each one individually.
You can imagine that with our very diverse product portfolio from the color and style standpoint, theres a lot of regionality, theres a lot of specificity in terms of ages and as we have been doing that, we have been seeing much higher returns on our ad spent and we think that with time we are going to continue get smarter and continue to get more and more targeted on our costs, not only our product development but also on our marketing and what is available.
John Enwright
Yeah. As we brought in new customers from masks, got new role kind of Harry Potter, we have been able to get their repeat purchases is better than average based on kind of specific earnings. So thats been helpful.
Oliver Chen
Thank you very much. Best regards.
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks, Oliver.

Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
Dana Telsey
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on Pura Vida. How you are speaking about the operating margins go forward in that business and also how you are thinking about planning it for 2021? And just to follow-up on the expenses, when you think about your fixed cost structure now versus pre-COVID, how much of the leverage do you see is impacting margins as the core business recover from COVID?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. From Pura Vida, well, we are still very excited about what the growth opportunity is in front of us with Pura Vida. A lot of initiatives are ahead of us. We think that from an operating margin, we believe that Pura Vida can continue to kind of begin at high-teens -- mid-to-high-teens operating margin. So we still feel very good about that business. From the expense standpoint, I will let John some color on that one.
John Enwright
Yeah. So from an expense perspective, we have a lot of fixed costs there. We saw some savings associated with certain items in the second quarter and third quarter that we likely wont see kind of in the fourth quarter and some of those savings you can think of as our personal savings as we took some reductions in salaries or other furlough positions that we took.
If you think about kind of core savings that we think we can see kind of into next year you can think of that as a discretionary savings and its likely in the low single-digit as a percentage of total expense base that we think will be permanent savings on a go forward basis.
Dana Telsey
Got it. And then when you think about the partnerships like with Disney, whats coming up that we should be marking our calendars for?
Rob Wallstrom
We havent put the other launch date out there, but what I can tell you is that we have a very robust pipeline next year that is both with character releases a lot of exciting news thats going to be coming.
So we will continue to build on our partnerships, with Disney continue to build on our partnerships with Harry Potter and you will also be seeing with Pura Vida been taking advantage of a lot of licensing opportunities next year.
So those are the seven things we are doing on kind of the character licensing side. And additionally we are continuing to do collaboration work like we have done this year and we have some exciting things in mind next year. So stay tuned.
Dana Telsey
Got it. And just lastly any more learnings on the project Novus [ph] side?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. I think our big learnings there is just continuing to become more responsive and technology and data driven and then everything that we did around that project was so that we can move more rapidly. We can make changes more rapidly.
We have seen in our prepared remarks you heard the comments we will make about the improvements in SEO and how we just really are able to move quicker, right, with our new infrastructure platform more able to make changes and how we execute and what we learn in probably a matter of days versus what might have been months before and that will just over time we will get smarter and better and better.
I think thats one of the big things in this new world with technology and data. Now its not a destination so to speak. Its kind of a journey, right? You keep getting better and better the more you know, the more you learn and you really build up a competitive advantage and thats what we are working on.
Dana Telsey
Thank you.
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks, Dana.
John Enwright
Thanks, Dana.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Beder of SCC Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Beder
Good morning.
Rob Wallstrom
Good morning, Eric.
John Enwright
Good morning.
Eric Beder
Hi. In Q4 you have been a lot more aggressive in terms of apparel and its not a store -- in the Vera Bradley stores, but with how to wear pajamas, robes and I think the response has been pretty positive. Is that kind of a one off holiday thing or should we be thinking about that as a potential category or some level of expansion going forward?
Rob Wallstrom
Thanks for the question, Eric. Yeah. During the fourth quarter, we definitely have expanded some of our apparel offerings really focusing on kind of key item areas and we have been very, very happy with the response from the consumer and we do think thats an area that you will see continued development.
One thing that we have always believed in both of these brands is that both brands are truly lifestyle brands. It not just a product they are actually our lifestyle. So we think that there is opportunity to have category expansion in both brands.
Eric Beder
Okay. And speaking of that category, when you put a Pura Vida store-in-store at our Vera Bradley store, did you tell us how -- what kind of -- how big is this in terms of the physical store and what are they selling in there beyond I guess the core, are they selling the entire Pura Vida line. How does that worked right now?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. We are still -- we are working on all of the final design. We have identified a location. So it is about an 800 square foot space. So its a -- its kind of on the smaller store footprint, which we think is a great opportunity for Pura Vida within jewelry store you dont need as much space therefore you get a much higher sales per square foot to make it more profitable in the long run.
In terms of the assortment, it really is going to be focusing on kind of a fairly broad assortment. As you have seen the metal jewelry business continues to be exceptionally strong, so that would be a big part of the assortment supported by the string bracelet business, but also some of these other exciting initiatives they have planned for next year that we will talk -- we will be talking more about on the next call, some of the new initiatives we will be launching in the store too.
John Enwright
Eric your question also in regards to the store and the store foot in the Vera Bradley stores or is it on specific to the Pura Vida new location?
Eric Beder
I think what you described is Pura Vida new location.
John Enwright
Yeah.
Eric Beder
How big is the inside of Vera Bradley -- like Vera Bradley shop as far as I guess?
John Enwright
I think its a shop and shop in Vera Bradley. We are testing a few different things. So we are testing in Birmingham. We gave a couple hundred square feet to Pura Vida and that was kind of a focused assortment on kind of their best-selling metal and string bracelets to kind of get a test up. We are rolling it out to additional stores and some of those presentations might be tighter.
One thing thats really great about Pura Vida is with the way they wall units work and how much product you can get in a very small square footage, you dont necessary need a lot of space. And so we are going to test a few different sizes, some of them might be 100 square feet, some of them might just be 12 linear speed of wall space. But it will be exciting to all that response. And then the charity bracelet program that will be in all of our stores will even be a tighter assortment. But we think its a real opportunity.
Whats been exciting is, we have seen a good response from our consumers, not only in the full line stores but also in our factory stores buying full price product, whether its been with Pura Vida or whether its been in some of our collaborations that we tested by Harry Potter in some of our factory stores. So we think theres a real opportunity to take advantage of some of this with all the traffic thats going to our factory stores.
Eric Beder
Okay. And finally on ReActive, you have had open for almost a year, next month it will be a year approximately. What other -- I know its been caught up unfortunately in the whole flow of everything else. But what kind of -- is it attracting the consumer you expected or are you expecting to be as aggressive with all the patterns of the pieces as you did in 2020. What do you expect to see ReActive kind of over the next, I guess, somewhat normalized year next year?
Rob Wallstrom
Yeah. We have been very happy with the ReActive performance, right? There were really two key elements of ReActive. One was really our first four year moving into sustainability. And the consumers really responded to that messaging and we have seen the younger customer really be attracted to that messaging. You are going to see us. We have made a real commitment to moving our full line assortments to a sustainable fabric platform as we move forward. So more exciting announcements next year, we think thats critically important and we have been very happy with the response.
The second piece of ReActive was just the more active lifestyle, and obviously, we have seen the consumer this year continue to get more casual, get more active. And I think we will continue to be leaning in that and how do we use ReActive to even have a stronger foothold in the active space.
Eric Beder
Great. Thanks. Good luck with the holiday -- rest of the holiday.
Rob Wallstrom
Thank you, Eric.

Good morning. Welcome to EnWave Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob and I'll be your operator for today's call.
Joining us for today's presentation are the company's President and CEO, Brent Charleton; CFO, Dan Henriques; and Executive Chairman, John Budreski. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. 
Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will be made available for replay via a link in the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.enwave.net.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to EnWaves CEO, Mr. Brent Charleton. Sir, please proceed.
Brent Charleton
Thank you and good morning to everyone. Before proceeding, I would like to make everybody aware that the information that we are about to present contains some forward-looking information. It is based on management's expectations, estimates and projections. These statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please consider the risk factors in the filings made by EnWave on SEDAR when reviewing this information. Also, all amounts will be in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. 
This is the second year that our company has held an annual conference call to provide a more comprehensive update about our business. We sincerely appreciate our stockholders [past] and continued support as we continue to pursue sustainable profitability in both of our business units. 
In this call, we will refer to our patented REV vacuum-microwave technology business units as EnWave and our Moon Cheese consumer snack product business as NutraDried. Fiscal 2020 was extremely challenging for both business units. But we engaged these challenges head on, made prudent operational decisions, refined our strategies and demonstrated that we could operate successfully in a linear fashion. In other words, we did more with less. 
Our efforts are materializing. We began to perform better in Q1 2021 with improving market conditions and are targeting significant improvements in all areas of our business going forward. 
In regards to EnWave specifically, the global pandemic led to a significant macroeconomic pullback which resulted in our pipeline of expected large scale REV machinery purchase orders to shrink through the year. We have several purchase orders targeted for the spring that were delayed indefinitely due to the uncertainty.
Given the bleak outlook in March, we quickly acted to significantly reduce expenses, approximately a 37% reduction, while maintaining EnWave's nimbleness to rebound and respond, when the business climate improved. And noticeable improvement didn't begin until September, at which point several REV machine purchase orders that were put on hold began to firm up. Since September, the sales activity in EnWave's business has increased substantially, and our sales pipeline is far more robust than it was in the summer. 
We essentially had our hands tied by COVID-19 for eight months of the fiscal year. Travel restrictions reduced our ability to proactively drive business in-person and challenged our international commissioning capabilities.
To combat the new restrictions, we enhanced and expanded our virtual marketing tools and international sales reps and referral network. We developed installation programs to remotely activate 10-kilowatt machines, and started REVworx, a toll manufacturing service that will further diversify our revenue streams and boost the commercialization of REV-dried products. We are confident that REVworx will need to more REV machines being sold and royalties generated. 
Despite the challenging circumstances, EnWave's REV technology business generated the second highest historical annual revenue, $9.9 million or $11.6 million when you include the NutraDried royalty, the highest gross profit in history of the business units and increased our gross margin by 24 percentage points.
Additionally, we successfully signed 10 new commercial royalty bearing licenses, one more than the year prior and a 24% increase in licenses overall, six new technology evaluation license option agreements and sold 11 new 10-kilowatt machines. The most impactful discrepancy between our fiscal 2020 performance versus our targets was the delay in large scale REV machine orders, which are now beginning to be realized in Q1 2021 with two already announced. These accomplishments contributed to EnWave's current consolidated cash position, which today is just over $18 million, which allows us to fund the build out of REVworx estimated to cost around $1.5 million, offer equipment financing to select partners for the deployment of 10-kilowatt REV machinery and invest in additional growth opportunities that fit with our business' growth plans. 
One example of our activity in challenging times was the establishment of global network of qualified sales representatives and referral partners. This action improved the efficiency of our sales team by leveraging external resources and reduces our dependence on international travel. This network has started to work for us including helping us secure two machine orders this year with Calbee, Japan's largest snack foods company. This has not been a small matter. We've successfully signed sales representation and referral agreements with third parties in Japan, Turkey, Scandinavia, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, United States, Brazil, The UAE, Thailand, Portugal and South Africa. We regularly check in with each company to provide them with translated marketing collateral to support their efforts. Each are required to submit summary reports of their efforts and each have performance requirements tied to REV purchase orders. This strategy should keep our S&amp;M overhead expenses flat, while providing upside to drive more business in 2021 and beyond. 
We learned quickly when the pandemic started that we cannot address the global market with a salesforce located just in Vancouver. And with an expanding sales rep and referral network globally, we're materially extending our reach. 
At the end of the summer, we announced that we'd be starting a new toll manufacturing operation, it's branded as REVworx. REVworx will be used as a tool to encourage more companies to bring REV-dried products to market allowing licensee prospects to test market products at scale, avoid upfront sizable CapEx and focus on product success. There are currently no adequate co-manufacturers or tolling operations that possess meaningful REV processing capacity in North America. REVworx will fill this gap. The targeted start-up date is March 2021 and thus far we are on budget and on time as per our plan. We got a great amount of interest in the service offering from potential customers and we expect to confirm our first customers prior to start-up. 
EnWave's performance in fiscal 2020 was also hindered by the material downturn in the Canadian cannabis industry. Our REV machinery sales in fiscal 2019 were dominated by cannabis royalty partners, and unfortunately, the projected domestic market failed to materialize, which led to many infrastructure projects being placed on hold or terminated, as well as significant belt tightening around CapEx decisions. Further, the use of REV technology at scale for the dehydration of cannabis was unproven until the late summer of 2020 when we completed the commissioning of a 60-kilowatt REV machine at The Green Organic Dutchmans facility in Ontario. 
As the cannabis market contracted, it became more difficult to pitch a theoretical value proposition which it was before the TGOD installed. We are far better positioned to sell REV equipment into the legal cannabis industry today than we were even three months ago with the TGOD commissioning. 
High-terpene content is a critical selling feature of premium products in the cannabis industry. And prior to the development of our Terpene Max process and its implementation on a commercial scale operating line, we did not have quantitative proof that REV technology preserves higher terpene levels and the industry standard of rack/room drying, we have it now. The recent announced confirmation that we have third-party certificates of analysis showing that Terpene Max can retain at least 10% more terpenes than room or rack drying is a major confirmation of our value propositions at the sector. 
REV technology is now proven to retain THC, CBD and total terpene levels that are in many cases better than the incumbents and at a minimum equal. Moving forward, we attempt to aggressively pursue legal cannabis opportunities in the U.S. and Canadian markets as well as international jurisdictions. We needed to equip ourselves with the right weaponry to improve our sales of REV into the growing legal cannabis industry. We're now equipped.
Overall, EnWave weathered the storm in 2020 and is positioned well for growth. Our strategic priorities for 2021 include: to develop our existing royalty partners products to grow the reoccurring royalty revenue streams; to capitalize on the global dairy industry with turnkey solutions for cheese snacks; to attack the alternative protein space by forming strategic partnerships and taking the lead on innovative product development; leverage the cannabis processing data we now have to revitalize commercial momentum; and increase our global reach through sales representation agreements and referral partners. 
We've had great momentum built in Q1 2021 with the sale of two large scale machines and four 10-kilowatt orders and are bullish regarding future REV machine sales given our robust pipeline of engaged leads.
Now on to NutraDried. When it became evident that the pandemic was frustrating the ability to secure meetings with new buyers to expand a number of distribution points for our Moon Cheese in 2020, management cut back planned production and lowered marketing spend. We were expecting NutraDried to gain meaningful new grocery and c-store distribution in 2020 to diversify away from Costco, but this did not happen quite as planned. When the pandemic hit, our sales team couldn't secure meetings or get commitments as a new product. And we missed on that target. This combined with lower overall velocities and targeted rotations in Costco not being realized at the level anticipated, resulting in a glut of inventory.
NutraDried pivoted and successfully secure a buy one get one free promotion with Costco in Q4 which allowed our operating subsidiary to convert dry cheese back into cash. This welcome liquidity provided some runway for the beefed up sales and marketing team to gain a new distribution that was pushed-off in 2020 and execute on their plan to achieve meaningful distribution growth in fiscal 2021. NutraDried accomplished several qualitative improvements in fiscal 2020, including a full brand relaunch, a revamped online presence and sales strategy, the introduction of three new flavors of Moon Cheese and the reorganization of their sales function, including the addition of an in-house dedicated sales group and marketing team, and a refinement of their broker network. 
The foundation for future success continued to be built during tough times, as NutraDried doubled their online sales, added 322 new retail customers, added over 37,000 new toll distribution points, which is the number of SKUs per store multiplied by number of stores, some of the notable wins include new 2 ounce distribution at multiple hours in Safeway, Ingles, Lowes, Hy-Vee and [BI] locations as well as big 1 ounce wins at Albertsons Safeway enterprise-wide, 650 Target stores, Rite Aid, CVS, Wawa, Maverick and Plaid Pantry, a leading convenience store chain.
Moving forward into fiscal 2021, NutraDried is focused on growth drivers for top and bottom-line improvement, including: increasing the product velocities by making improvements to the core product offerings; drive grocery distribution for the 2 and 1 ounce Moon Cheese and the new protein blitz mix launching in Q2, which is a mix of nuts and cheese. This is a clear opportunity for growth with us currently having less than 25% distribution in U.S. grocery retail. This is a major priority with 14,000 new stores targeted this upcoming year. They hope to derive more profitability from club stores via everyday innovation, and deliver regular and more consistent rotations by offering new product formats and exclusive flavors. Another main point is, they're going to leverage new products online with key customers. These new product launching is via Amazon and the NutraDried web store will be used as testing grounds to identify long-term winners for brick-and-mortar sales distribution. And lastly, lowering costs and regaining financial leverage.
We firmly believe that NutraDried has legitimate potential to grow significantly in the coming 12 to 24 months, and the strategy developed by our management team is sound. The obstacles thrown in front of us in 2020 by the pandemic are behind us, and we're hoping to get commitments from major retailers for new distribution in fiscal 2021. 
I'll now pass the baton to Dan who will summarize our financial performance in Q4 and the 2020 fiscal year.
Dan Henriques
Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We'll take a few moments to review the fiscal 2020 and Q4 2020 results. Please note the figures I'll be going over today can be found in our press release this morning, and all amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. 
As highlighted by Brent, fiscal 2020 presented EnWave with many challenges that are reflected in our full year financial results. For the full year, we've reported consolidated revenue of $32.8 million, of which $9.9 million came from EnWave's technology business and $22.9 million came from NutraDried's product sales. Revenue at EnWave and NutraDried were each lower by 23% respectively, when compared to the prior year. The hit to our revenue on both sides is reflective of the challenges that Brent previously mentioned. 
For Q4 2020, we reported consolidated revenues of $10.7 million, a substantial jump compared to the $5.9 million reported in Q3 2020, but lower than the $16.1 million from Q4 of 2019. EnWave had $1.6 million in revenues, and NutraDried had $9.1 million in revenues for the fourth quarter.
EnWave's revenues are still heavily influenced by our REV machinery sales. And EnWave's sold fewer than planned large-scale machines in 2020. Many of our royalty partners delayed capital projects to scale up capacity because of the pandemic and the challenging economic environment, with many wanting to wait until conditions improve to launch new products. 
EnWave's revenues for Q1-Q2 2020 were $6.7 million compared to $3.2 million for Q3-Q4 2020, with the drop in the second half of the year reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on our equipment sales. Our machinery sales process has historically been high touch and the pandemic along with the travel restrictions tied our hands in many ways.
That said, since the end of the fiscal year starting in October, we're extremely encouraged by improved selling conditions and have announced many new machine orders compared to the challenging April-September 2020 time period.
EnWave reported third-party royalties of $835,000 for 2020 compared to $735,000 for 2019, a lift of $100,000 or 14%. Our royalties are a function of the amount of REV-dried product sold by our royalty partners. We start generating royalties once a machine is fully installed and commissioned, and the travel restrictions delayed our ability to start-up several international machines during the fiscal year.
Looking forward, we have three large scale machines that have been delivered with installations underway. Once commissioned, these machines will materially increase our royalty base in addition to several small scale 10-kilowatt machines that are being remotely commissioned. We're eager for expansion and growth to our royalty streams in 2021.
Turning now to NutraDried. NutraDried's revenues were lower primarily due to lower sales to Costco and Starbucks, two major accounts. Our sales to Starbucks were materially impacted by the COVID-19 shutdown with nearly all Starbucks locations across the U.S. closing for an extended period of time and then reopening under conditions not conducive to Moon Cheese purchases. Our distribution at Costco has never been permanent. And we depend on regional buyers to bring the product in on rotations, which we gained fewer of in 2021 when compared to 2019. The pandemic also caused many of our retailers to temporarily close or remain open under augmented conditions during the peak lockdowns in April to July.
Our plan for NutraDried in fiscal 2020 was to achieve meaningful new distribution in the retail grocery and c-store channels. This plan was delayed due to the pandemic and we're now actively pursuing growth in these priority channels for 2021. We are also aiming to continue to secure product rotations at Costco, a channel that can provide meaningful volumes, although this can be lumpy and hard to predict.
There were several bright spots in the year that I'd like to highlight. Our retail grocery sales, which includes the natural channel grew by [18% 18:44]] year-over-year, and our online sales grew by 100% on Amazon and our website. These channels are strategically important, and where we plan to pursue even more meaningful growth in the next 12 to 24 months.
Our sales team has shown that once we're able to get in the door to pitch the product, we have a very high hit rate. And with this now getting -- with us now getting more important buyer meeting scheduled in the fall and winter months, we're meeting awaiting commitments early in the New Year.
In Q4, 2020, we executed a national promotion at Costco on a buy one get one discount, contributing approximately $5 million to NutraDried's Q4 2020 net revenue. The promotion was at a discount to normal rotational margins and served to liquidate a substantial portion of NutraDrieds inventory position and bolster the company's treasury. While we do not plan to do this again, unless absolutely necessary, the result was a net positive for the company given the situation.
Our consolidated gross margin for 2020 was 27% compared to 32% for 2019, a decrease of 5-percentage points. The primary driver behind this was lower sales volumes and higher trade spending at NutraDried. 
Broken out by segment, NutraDrieds margin was 25% for fiscal 2020, down from 44% in fiscal 2019. NutraDrieds margins for 2020 were downwardly impacted by higher block cheese pricing by approximately 19% relative to 2019, lower production volumes from Q2 through Q4 resulting in lower absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs and more trade spending in the fourth quarter as part of the buy one get one promotion at Costco in the U.S. We know NutraDried can deliver much better margins when economies of scale are achieved at our manufacturing plants. Our plan for 2021 has us returning to higher production volumes. And if we achieve our targeted sales growth, we expect our gross margins will be in the high 30s percentage range.
EnWave's gross margin profile improved substantially in 2020. We increased gross margin to 29% compared to just 5% in 2019, an improvement of 24 percentage points, not including royalties paid by NutraDried to EnWave. The improved margins were achieved through deliberate strategy that I would like to highlight to our investors.
EnWaves margin improved due to the implementation of a new pricing strategy in January, that increased the price of REV machinery by approximately 15%, paired with significant reductions to our fixed manufacturing costs in the year. Brent mentioned, we set out to cut costs and we're aggressive in seeking to improve margins. 
In Q2 2020, we reduced our manufacturing headcount by 13 personnel, consolidated our manufacturing operations and subleased three warehouse space, eliminated the use of contractors and increased the use of outsourced fabricators. The result was approximately $1 million in overhead savings in Q3-Q4 or $2 million on an annualized basis. We are confident we can deliver growth in our REV machinery sales in 2021, while maintaining this new leaner fabrication capability.
Our SG&amp;A expenses for 2020 are reflective of higher SG&amp;A spending in Q1 and Q2, offset by cuts to SG&amp;A expenses made in Q3 and Q4 after implementing cost containment measures. At the end of Q2 2020 and in response to the anticipated negative impacts of COVID-19 on both segments of the business, we implemented a cost containment strategy to preserve liquidity and cut costs in a challenging environment. The steps taken to lower SG&amp;A expenses starting in Q3 included reducing the use of external legal, Investor Relations and other professional services, eliminating trade shows and employee travel and replacing them with lower cost digital tools, cutting back on non-essential marketing spending at NutraDried and related agencies fees and reducing our employee headcount.
The objective was to reduce SG&amp;A expenses to critical functions while maintaining a fully functional sales team to execute against our growth objectives. The savings generated were realized in our Q3 and Q4 results with our combined SG&amp;A expenses for Q3-Q4 2020 being $2.1 million lower than Q1-Q2 2020, an annualized reduction rate of $4.2 million or 31%. 
Looking ahead to 2021, we plan to continue to operate with strict control over our expenses and do not plan to significantly increase our SG&amp;A spending from the Q3-Q4 levels. I'm very encouraged to tell you that we continue to operate at deep SG&amp;A levels into Q1 2021 and we believe this level of SG&amp;A spending is sustainable and capable of supporting revenue growth in both sides of the business.
The company received $1.6 million of government assistance reported as Other Income from stimulus programs launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. EnWave received $658,000 of funds under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy Program. And NutraDried received $961,000 of funds from the U.S. Federal Government's Paycheck Protection Program.
Our adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure was a loss of $3.2 million for 2020, which was $3.2 million income for 2019. Please refer to disclosures in our annual MD&amp;A regarding non-IFRS financial measures, including a reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and net loss. In Q4 2020, our adjusted EBITDA rebounded to positive $20,000. For fiscal 2021, we're expecting NutraDried sales volumes to meaningfully increase and return the subsidiary to cash flow positivity. If that target isn't achieved, we'll be looking at additional cost reduction measures to improve profitability.
Now turning to our balance sheet. The cost containment measures implemented by the company in Q3-Q4 were intended to preserve liquidity and maintain a strong balance sheet, which we achieved. We finished the year with $14.7 million in cash on hand and a working capital surplus of $24 million. We used $1.7 million in cash in 2020 to fund our operations, not including increases to working capital.
Aside from leases and a small line of credit at NutraDried, our balance sheet is largely debt free and we have the appropriate financial resources to execute on our growth strategy heading into fiscal 2021. As of today, our cash position is over $18 million giving us ample resources to complete the build out for REVworx, which is budgeted at approximately $1.5 million.
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Brent for some closing remarks.
Brent Charleton
Thanks, Dan. By making decisive prudent decisions early in the pandemic, we preserved cash allowing us to adapt our tactics and diversify our commercialization strategy through fiscal 2020, setting the stage for us to accelerate growth and financial performance in fiscal 2021. Recently, we instituted a Normal Course Issuer Bid Program to buy back common shares, if our continued commercial progress does not adequately manifest in our share price. Since September, both NutraDried and EnWave have experienced material upticks in business opportunities, and we anticipate a very busy year ahead.
Our plans for 2021 include meaningful growth at NutraDried and will target material distribution increases in the retail grocery, c-store and online channels, the areas we see to being the most strategically important. We also plan to continue winning rotations of Moon Cheese in the club channel as part of our broader channel strategy. Sales growth and EBITDA improvement are imperative key productivity indicators for NutraDried to achieve. 
EnWave's targets include closing five large-scale REV machines and 12 10-kilowatt machines, as well as securing an initial anchor client for REVworx. We remain focused on top-line growth while prudently managing expenses. And if we achieve our targets, we should generate positive adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021. 
The core mission of EnWave is to build a long-term diversified portfolio of royalties, generated from the commercial success of different REV-dried products selling in multiple geographies around the world. The rate of adoption of REV products and REV technology is accelerating and we're constantly finding products and opportunities where our technology is superior. We now have a broad commercialization strategy that includes the REVworx toll manufacturing division, the start-up of REVworx to accelerate the launch of REV-dried products to market, derisk to the adoption of REV technology, and ultimately lead to increased machine sales and royalty generation. 
Our management team is confident that we have deployed the right strategies and tactics to maximize and accelerate the monetization of our market leading patented drying technology.
And with that, I'm going to end my prepared remarks and open the call for your questions. Operator, please provide the appropriate instructions. 
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Steve Hansen with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.
Steve Hansen
First one, Brent, is on the REVworx opportunity. A couple actually related to that if I may. The first is, you mentioned an anchor client that you want to secure here. Can you just give us a sense for what you're looking for in that anchor client? And what sort of -- I guess quantum of customers you're looking to secure ultimately to fill it up? I'm trying to get a sense for the split of business you might have or the customer mix you might have in there to start?
Brent Charleton
Yes, no problem, Steve. Thanks for the question. So initially, our REVworx tolling facility will have a continuous 60-kilowatt quantaREV unit and three 10-kilowatt batch units. We define an anchor customer or client as one that would make up at least 25% of capacity utilization on that line. And when we're modeling out REVworx, we're targeting profitability on that business unit in 2022 conservatively.
Steve Hansen
Okay, great. And then just -- I'm just trying to understand the opportunity for you sort of longer term. It clearly makes a lot of sense in terms of helping commercialize earlier stage brands or even perhaps larger stage brands. But what is the goal of yours to migrate into a larger sort of toll manufacturing business over time where you can commit additional capital beyond 1.6 to 1.8 initially?
Brent Charleton
No. So the ideal scenario would be that REVworx is used as a tool to compel additional companies to become long-term royalty partners of EnWave. And so the pricing is structured to say entice those who leverage REVworx initially to bring products to market to take a hard look at bringing manufacturer in-house longer term.
What we've encountered in times past is, companies will step back because they don't want to deploy not just $2.5 million for a large scale REV line, But there's also a lot of investment needed to get their facilities to a point to launch new products to market and with REVworx, they can avoid that upfront, prove out their hypothetical business case, and then ultimately, again invest in their own line to be used internally.
Steve Hansen
Okay, that's helpful. Just one if I may on the -- on thinking about new products. I think you'd mentioned earlier in terms of growing, you mentioned a couple priorities for growth. One was capitalizing on the global dairy industry. And sort of a broader steam, you also mentioned attacking alternative protein space. Just want to -- may be describe on what that means to sort of the product set going forward, just trying to understand that in sort of a bit more specific terms?
Brent Charleton
Yes, absolutely. So we look at the alternative protein space and how fast that is growing in true traditional formats that are trying to mimic other fresh true protein products, right? And so what we've done is we've gone out and engaged with some -- several of the market leaders, procured their raw materials, ran through our pilot plant as a proof-of-concept, and now stimulated some intense dialogue. And we anticipate that some of these companies will enter into formal evaluation agreements in the near term here. And ultimately, we love to see our first licensees in the space in North America in 2021.
Steve Hansen
Okay, great. I'll just do one more and then I'll jump back in the queue to be respectful. But just wanted to think about the NutraDried opportunity a little more specifically in terms of securing this diversification you've mentioned. Are you guys pretty confident in that diversification for the year? It sounds like you are. But I just wanted to get a sense for what the cadence will be around new announcements to sort of give us some clarity on how that diversification will let us going in terms of new store growth rate, et cetera. Should we think thats through Q1-Q2, is that the right way to think about it?
Dan Henriques
Yes. Steve. I'll take this one. Its Dan here. We've had -- during the height of the pandemic, we had challenges getting meetings. NutraDried sales team were out trying to get endorsed as a new product. But as a small company, we had challenges in the summer -- spring, summer months. Over the -- in the early fall, and up to today, we had a number of several of very important meetings with large retailers in the U.S. specifically in the retail grocery channel and some in the c-store channel. And so, we're awaiting commitments for those distribution points hopefully early in the New Year. So, gaining an out by quarter, it will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year with some coming on in Q2, and then Q3-Q4 being more meaningful.
Brent Charleton
And just to follow up on that, Steve, well have good clarity on what the second half of year looks like for NutraDried by the end of January, into mid-February, based on commitments to place product in new distribution points.
Operator
The next question is from the line of Bart Goemaere with Beurstips. Please proceed with your question.
Bart Goemaere
Hi, Brent and Dan. A question about the cash position. You stated that the cash position was $18 million more or less. How much cash there still need to come in from the Costco action?
Brent Charleton
As of today, we have collected all of the cash from the Costco orders related to the BOGO that was shipped in September. We've had some more rotations in the Costco in Q1. So as a customer, we always have receivables from Costco. But from the promotion in Q4, the balance of that's been collected, Bart.
Bart Goemaere
Okay. And then they have a small question about the termination of the Tilray license. Does that also mean that the sub-license license has been terminated?
Brent Charleton
Yes. Bart, the agreement originally with Tilray was one where we got a proof-of-concept to market in REV for cannabis applications. And the way that it was set up originally with the sub-license rates for Tilray, we made it very clear to the market that we anticipated them to be a net zero royalty payer long-term based on our acquisition of additional users of REV in cannabis in Canada. So the upside in terms of that Tilray interest was always going to be minimal. Unfortunately, internally from an operation standpoint, Tilray was building out GMP facilities and ordered non-GMP machines, and didn't conversate with us on that point before committing capital and us delivering those pieces of kit. So, ultimately the termination of our relationship with them is not a reflection of the viability of our tech in the space. It's more so of a business relationship that turned out to be not very strong.
Bart Goemaere
Yes. But it means also that any royalties in Canada directly will go to EnWave now?
Brent Charleton
Yes, correct. So, TGOD and Aurora with their 220 kilowatt machines and any others that sign on will go directly to EnWave without any share of future carried interest. And that's the case across the board in different geographies at this point. 
Operator
The next question is from line of Neil Linsdell with Industrial Alliance. Please proceed with your questions.
Neil Linsdell 
Do you mind going into a little bit more detail about on the retail side with your Moon Cheese distribution into the new customers that you're talking about? How much more penetration can you get out of existing clients? Can you upsell that with the new flavors, the new products that you're bringing in? Are there additional distribution points in those retailers, like you're in 50% of the stores, you can go to 100%? Or is it all about new customers signing off? 
Brent Charleton
Thanks, Neil. The answer to that question would be quite complex. And we can certainly move into a follow-up offline. But in general, yes, there's a huge amount of opportunity to achieve additional distribution points, if you look at as individual formats being sold in perhaps singular locations. So, we mentioned in the summary about Safeway Albertsons bringing both 2 ounce and 1 ounce into their ecosystem, where 1 ounce has gotten enterprise-wide distribution, whereas Albertsons Safeway is only taking about, call it, 30% to 40%, for the 2 ounce. So, there's obviously ample room for growth there. We've also identified the additional 14,000 locations for different grocery store distribution companies, which can be added to increased sales for Moon Cheese on a go forward basis. 
So, short answer, yes, of these three or four placements in store, where Moon Cheese can be sold, it's about the individual buyers within those different grocery companies, and whether or not they'll bring on more than one SKU per store. 
Neil Linsdell 
And Dan just made a comment about not wanting to repeat something with Costco next year, and that's the liquidation of the inventory. But as far as the Costco relationship, you're continuing to expect rotations among the different divisions?
Dan Henriques
Yes, Neil, we're continuing to target rotations at Costco. Its part of our core business strategy. We want to maintain our business at Costco. That said, Costco, we're dealing with individual buyers, individual regions. So, our experience is that it's lumpy and sometimes hard to predict when we're going to get those rotations. And sometimes they pile up at particular times of the year and other times will go a month or two without one. So, Costco remains an important customer and important channel for us. And we're going to continue to diversify our sales outside of Costco by growing in those meaningful retail grocery and c-store points of distribution over the next year, but certainly Costco remains an important customer that we're targeting, continuing rotations. 
Brent Charleton
And to add to that, with the pipeline of new products that will be taken to market in terms of different flavor profiles and formats, I mentioned the protein blitz mix, those are the type of unique new offerings that we will be taking to those such as Costco and others, sometimes on a semi-exclusive basis to provide them with some unique offerings to their customer base. So, we're again bullish on prospects for 21. We're hampered by 2020 COVID-related cancellation for meetings and we think that the management team at NutraDried is set up to have some good success. 
Neil Linsdell 
And just you touched on lessons learned or pleased that you've managed to change the business to deal with COVID and travel restrictions and such. Are there any of these changes that are going to become more permanent or more ingrained in what you're doing or as soon as we get the vaccine and the immunity, you're going to be back full force with the trade shows and everything like that?
Brent Charleton
No, we're not going to go back to the way things were. We've learned a lot and a lot of our practices that we're employing now are here to stay. Some of which includes a 10-kilowatt remote installations. We don't actually have to send personnel internationally to complete those. We've got the necessary collateral to teach and train our new licensees in that respect. The trade show attendance, we're also going to pare back because we see more realistic opportunities to sign licenses coming from our sales and referral partner network, as well as we have been quite I think efficient using the virtual tools that we've developed to engage companies online. So I don't imagine us going from zero to another couple of 100,000 spent on trade shows in 2021 and beyond. 
Neil Linsdell
Okay. And just, really, based on what Steve was asking before about the REVworx. With this -- I remember when you started up NutraDried, it was really kind of a proof of concept to show Moon Cheese and what acceptance it could have within the retail environment and obviously that's been a ridiculous success. Now, if I look at REVworx, the way it's being set up as a toll manufacturer, couldn't that still become a very significant piece of the business and kind of eclipse your initial expectations right now? And secondly, would you be using that to basically take any kind of production overflow in heavy times thats from NutraDried, to say? 
Brent Charleton
So answer the first question, we certainly hope it becomes such a success that we end up building up that service offering, because there's more companies engaged to get new products to market. We are very much opportunist in terms of different product applications that may be first commercialized using REVworx. We may look at that or these types of launches as new NutraDried opportunities for us to participate, we don't know yet. But there are a few things that we're -- or I would say clients that we're targeting to get confirmation before March that are bringing new products to market that are intriguing us. 
In regards to having capacity overrun for NutraDried, probably not at this point, because we're using quantaREV 60-kilowatt versus the nutraREV systems which are being employed at NutraDried now, that's not to say that a year down the line we may have a nutraREV system at REVworx. And in that case, certainly we would use that as capacity overrun for them. 
Neil Linsdell 
And can you touch on a little -- any kind of additional color on the U.S. market for cannabis and you've started up a new subsidiary I think in October to be able to deal with some of those opportunities? 
Brent Charleton
Yes. We're actually thrilled with the amount of inbound inquiries about our technology from U.S. based legal cannabis producers. I would anticipate some good momentum going into Q2 in that space. The recent MORE Act that was just passed by Congress in the U.S. is encouraging. Our fingers are crossed that the Senate races in Georgia here, provides the decision making power to the Democrats and then we hope that decriminalization and broader legalization for the cannabis industry comes into effect in the U.S. in late 2021. But bottom-line, we've done the due diligence legally and feel more than comfortable selling machines into states that are legal to produce cannabis and we anticipate that being a core piece of our business development next year. 
Neil Linsdell 
Okay. And just promise one more question here, maybe settle that field. You used to have significant development that you were looking at with pharma companies. Has there been any kind of conversations recently about using your technology for any of the vaccines that might be in development or any pickup in the pharma business? 
Dan Henriques
I will take that one, Neil. So as you're aware, we announced a partnership -- a joint development agreement with GEA Lyophil out of Germany, the largest equipment manufacturer to the pharmaceutical industry globally. We announced in January 2020 and we've made a lot of progress under that agreement with GEA throughout the year. Some of that was -- I mean we took -- there was a little bit of a break in early months of the pandemic. And then kind of in like the late summer, we started to get a number of new inbound inquiries about our technology and how it applies to dehydration, shelf stabilization of vaccines.
And so we've been working with GEA on that front, and they're handling inbound inquiries, and theyve purchased a pilot scale machine that's headed over to Germany. Were building it now it and should be there in the spring of 2021 to use as a demonstration machine to show pharmaceutical companies what REV technology is capable of doing so. The activity has picked up and we're advancing under this joint partnership with GEA. And we hope to see pharma be a part of the long-term vision of EnWave as a business.
Brent Charleton
That as well, Neil, just to -- that Merck is active right now. They've been -- they were announced partner, they own R&amp;D license, they own REV equipment for pharmaceutical, more specifically vaccine dehydration. And that project is very active at the moment.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of [James Dillon] with [Elverum Asset Management]. Please proceed with your questions.
Unidentified Analyst 
I'm curious about the progress that you have going on with the U.S. Army with regards to using EnWave technology for rations?
Brent Charleton
Yes. It's progressing very well, all things considered. So they currently own two pieces of pilot scale REV equipment to develop these shelf stable rations primarily targeted at close combat soldiers. That's gone through their system and gotten a green light from several of their personnel. And now they're looking to engage with a third-party industry partner in the U.S. that would prospectively take additional REV equipment and process these rations had been approved on a larger scale. That company or industry partner would then sell those components to one of, I believe, it's four or five approved vendors of the total military ration pack, AmeriQual is one and Wornick I believe is another.
So right now, we are in talks and discussing how that ecosystem would look from a licensing perspective. And we also understand the U.S. Army is pursuing funding to expand their REV capacity. So we're bullish on the longer term future with the U.S. Armed Forces. It's a matter of timing here, I believe.
Operator
The next question is from the run of Steve Hansen with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.
Steve Hansen
Just one follow-up. Brent, how do you think about the optimal capital position for the company here? The [$18 million] cash pile is obviously very enviable, given the current macro backdrop here and gives you some good strategic flexibility to perceive things like REVworx, but it's probably also not an optimal position. I know, you would like to have a large reserve to deal with your counterparties -- larger counterparties. But what is the right capital position here for the company? Presumably it's not on a cash position like this for the long-term?
Brent Charleton
To answer your question, I think we're well capitalized at the moment. That's why we're considering the usage of NCIB, because we have funds available. And if the valuation of our shares go down to a price where we don't feel that our progress has been fairly valued, that we'll take advantage of that. So our willingness tells you that we feel comfortable with our cash position as well as investing in the $1.5 million REVworx. Longer term, it's important that we have some strength on the balance sheet. When prospective licensees are looking at our company, they want to be sure that we're going to continue to be a going concern and have some -- have ability to grow with their businesses respectively. So I suppose my short answer to you right now is that we're quite comfortable with our cash position today, don't feel like we need to add significantly to that to accomplish what we need to, to grow the business. And we'll be opportunistic when the time comes, if it does with the NCIB.
Steve Hansen
And may be just a slight clarification. And just, what is that cushion that you need to keep those counterparties comfortable? Is it $10 million, $5 million? I mean, I don't know if you actually have a number but. 
Brent Charleton
Yes, $10 million would be sufficient, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is follow from the line of [James Dillon] with [Elverum Asset Management]. Please proceed with your question 
Unidentified Analyst 
Yes, I have a question about your Normal Course Issuer Bid. Your stock went down to CAD0.56 at some point during I think it was the third quarter and yet you didn't buy any shares. I mean, wouldn't you say that share price at that low would be an opportunistic time to buy back shares?
Brent Charleton
Hi, James. Absolutely, I would agree with you on that front. And we -- that was the impetus to implement the Normal Course Issuer Bid. So when the share price dipped to that position, we didn't have the NCIB in place. We've implemented in October. So we've had it for about a little over two months. And so in the future, as we see the share price not reflecting the value that has been created in the company and the growth prospects, we will use it in those situations. 
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Brent Charleton, CEO, for closing remarks.
