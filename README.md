## Merger and Acquisition Project - by Ayca E., Antony J., Hamza M.


# Project Motivation 

## Key Questions 

- Can we predict whether or not a merger will succeed or fail when it is announced? 

- Will sentiment from the news help us determine whether or not a merger will succeed? 

- How does the sentiment of a merger announcement change during the due diligence period? 

- Can we avoid future merger disasters? 

## Our Approach

- Natural Language Processing/ Sentiment Analysis/ Topic Modelling 

- Proxy Success KPI: Buyer’s stock price on date of announcement vs (closing date, vs one-year after merger) 

- Back-test analysis on three-mergers (see below)

## Conclusions: NLP M&A 2.0 

General Conclusions: 

- Insightful exercise, different/unique approach to analyzing mergers and acquisitions 

- Cannot confidently state that we are capable of predicting the outcome as successful or not

- Important to read the negative sentiment articles to identify conspicuous merger risks 


Limitations on Current Analysis ;

- Evaluating history does not equal reliable future predictor. (i.e. Hindsight is 20/20) 

- Technical understanding limitation -> how exactly does the sentiment analyzer categorize an article as “positive”, “neutral”, “negative” 

- Are we incorrectly categorizing articles? 

- Sampling Bias: Inherit positivity bias in merger announcements and closings when looking at news articles 

- Data/$ Limitation: News articles alone may be insufficient, better to analyze equity research reports

- Stock Price: May not be best proxy to evaluate merger success given materiality thresholds 


If we had more time/resources ($)? 
- Hire Nabila as Senior Data Scientist Manager to explore other NLP/ML techniques 

- Evaluate equity research reports 

- Implement other financial metrics on the analysis (Debt, EBITDA, synergies, etc) 

- Topic Modeling Exploration -> evaluate alternative sources
